##Current "What I do during the day" status (work, student, mine bitcoins, etc)
>I am currently an analyst at a digital ad agency (Razorfish) working on hospitality clients. I spend most of my day in SQL and Excel, so Python will be a welcome change. 
##A few examples of data you're interested in working with, or have worked with in the past

>I also enjoyed analyzing the user experience of being exposed to travel advertising and how it effects customer behaviour.

##An interesting blog post or website that is data oriented that you recently read or found.
>This is an interesting article about the effect that data science has on decision making:
