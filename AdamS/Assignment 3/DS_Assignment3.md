# What was the name of the algorithm you read about?
> Anomaly Detection
# What data problem does it solve? (listed under Technique on previous page)
> Detecting rare cases or outliers in Data
# In layman's terms, what does the algorithm do? Even if you aren't sure, that's okay! Just try your best--we're not looking for perfect answers.
> Anomaly detection (as supported by Oracle) uses a one class SVM model to detect outliers. The model will score each data point based on the central tendency of the data set. It will then (by default) isolate the 10% of cases that are farthest from the central tendency and classify them as anomalous. 
# Come up with up to three applications of this algorithm in business. Try relating it to your own job or line of work, your other data interests, or what have you.
> Detecting fraudulent display impressions based on rate of impression delivery
> Detecting bot traffic to sites based on speed of clicks and pages consumed
> Cleaning data to remove outliers that might skew the final analysis
