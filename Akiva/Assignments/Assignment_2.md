#Assignment #2

*Name: Technically, Kenneth, but people usually call me Akiva

*What I do during the day: I manage admissions for most of General Assembly’s technical courses in New York City.

*Data I'm interested in: Financial modeling, business analytics, sports statistics, investing, quantitative research.

*Why I signed up: I’m really excited to take this course so I can develop my analytics skillset, and hopefully transition into a more data centric position GA.

*Interesting Website: I’ve recently come across Aswath Damodran, a corporate finance professor at NYU Stern’s school of business. I haven't looked at it too extensively, but [this](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/home.htm) has been in my bookmark bar for a little while
