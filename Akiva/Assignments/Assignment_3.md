#Assignment #3

## What was the name of the algorithm you read about?

* Naive Bayes

## What data problem does it solve? (listed under Technique on previous page)

* Most commonly used technique for predicting a specific outcome such as response / no-response, high / medium / low-value customer, likely to buy / not buy.

## In layman's terms, what does the algorithm do? Even if you aren't sure, that's okay! Just try your best--we're not looking for perfect answers.

* Bayes' Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. 

## Come up with up to three applications of this algorithm in business. Try relating it to your own job or line of work, your other data interests, or what have you.

* Probability that someone will enroll in a course on condition that they take a class or a workshop
* Probability that someone with x background will get a job in data science related field if they take the data science course.
* Probability that a someone will take a course at GA if they've been refered by someone who's taken a class
