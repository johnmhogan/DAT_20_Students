1. Dan Bourbeau
2. I work in Property Management as a software manager. I went to school for Industrial Engineering. 
3. The data I'm most interested is energy and water consumption and other municipal usage data. I want to merge high level consumption metrics with the granular individual usage. NYC Open Data is a resource i frequent.
4. I would like to get a job at the Energy Information Agency, a government agency that tracks all state and federal energy resource production and consumption.
5. The [GlobalCalcujlator](http://www.globalcalculator.org/) is similar to the app I want to build in the near future. I believe this app is too high level for the common person.
