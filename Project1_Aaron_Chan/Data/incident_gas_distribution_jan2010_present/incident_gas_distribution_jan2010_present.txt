INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:  ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2014, MILLER PIPELINE CORP., A CONTRACTOR PERFORMING WORK FOR ATMOS ENERGY LOUISIANA DIVISION, WAS SCHEDULED TO DEACTIVATE AND ABANDON A 4"" PE GAS LINE ON HWY 21 @ N. AZALEA IN COVINGTON, LA. THIS WAS A COOL DAY WITH LOW HUMIDITY.    MILLER PIPELINE EMPLOYEE ANTHONY DUNCAN (CREW FOREMAN) WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS WORK AND WAS QUALIFIED IN THE ASSOCIATED OQ TASKS.  - ALL LINE STOPPERS UTILIZED TO BLOCK THE SOURCE OF GAS WERE INSTALLED PREVIOUSLY.  - BEFORE BEGINNING THE PURGING PROCESS, MR. DUNCAN CHECKED TO MAKE SURE ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED FROM THE GAS LINE TO BE DEACTIVATED.  - AFTER CONFIRMATION THAT ALL SOURCES OF GAS WERE BLOCKED, MR. DUNCAN PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE VALVE (ON PURGE RISER) TO BEGIN DE-PRESSURING AND BLOWING DOWN THE GAS FROM THE LINE. HE WAITED 15 - 20 MINUTES FOR THE LINE TO BLOW DOWN.  - ONCE HE THOUGHT THE LINE WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN DOWN, MR. DUNCAN GOT IN THE EXCAVATION TO REMOVE THE BLOW DOWN RISER. HE USED 2-INCH PLASTIC CUTTERS TO PERFORM THIS TASK. IT WAS DURING THIS PROCESS THAT THE RESIDUAL GAS IN THE PIPE IGNITED AND A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED INJURING MR. DUNCAN.  - MR. DUNCAN WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS HELD OVERNIGHT FOR TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION.    CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT:  IT SEEMS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE GAS LINE TO BE ABANDONED WAS NOT PURGED OF GAS PROPERLY, ALLOWING RESIDUAL GAS TO REMAIN IN THE LINE. SECONDLY, PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL IGNITION WERE NOT FOLLOWED BY NOT PROPERLY GROUNDING THE PIPE OR TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING THE PURGE RISER. STATIC ELECTRICITY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF IGNITION OF THE RESIDUAL GAS. THIRDLY, MR. DUNCAN WAS NOT WEARING THE PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT) FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING/GLOVES. THIS ADDED PROTECTION COULD HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES. FOURTHLY, MR. DUNCAN SENT HIS HELPER (ON FIRE WATCH) AWAY TO PERFORM ANOTHER JOB DUTY. BY HAVING SOMEONE ON FIRE WATCH AT THE EXCAVATION WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER COULD ALSO HAVE MINIMIZED THE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES, BY EITHER EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE RIGHT AWAY OR PULLING MR. DUNCAN OUT OF THE EXCAVATION AND AWAY FROM THE FIRE.     ROOT CAUSE:  THERE SEEMS TO BE HUMAN ERROR IN JUDGMENT BY MR. DUNCAN IN SEVERAL INSTANCES INVOLVING FOLLOWING PROCEDURES AND SAFETY POLICIES; THE BELOW FACTORS IN COMBINATION RELATED TO THE CAUSE OF THE FLASH FIRE WHICH RESULTED IN THE INCIDENT:  - DID NOT PURGE NATURAL GAS FROM DEACTIVATED LINE BY USING AIR OR NITROGEN GAS;  - DID NOT CHECK FOR COMPLETE PURGING (0% GAS) OF NATURAL GAS WITH A CGI (COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR) FROM THE PURGE RISER;  - DID NOT PRACTICE PREVENTING STATIC ELECTRICITY HAZARD BY USING SOAPY WATER OR ANTI-STATIC SPRAY AND BURLAP SACK ON PLASTIC PIPE AND ALSO GROUNDING TOOLS PRIOR TO CUTTING PURGE RISER FROM DEACTIVATED PIPE.  THIS ALONG WITH RESIDUAL GAS IN THE DEACTIVATED PIPE RESULTED IN A FLASH FIRE WHICH CAUSED THE INJURY.  - DID NOT WEAR PROPER PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT); FIRE RETARDANT CLOTHING AND GLOVES.  - DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER WORKER AT PURGE LOCATION ON FIRE WATCH WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.     THE ABOVE INSTANCES (WHICH WERE NOT FOLLOWED) ARE COVERED IN ATMOS ENERGY'S O&M PROCEDURES AND SAFETY MANUAL; THEY ARE ALSO COVERED UNDER OQ TASKS L2 - ACTIVATING AND PURGING PIPELINES AND M8 - PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL IGNITION."

A THIRD PARTY (GM ENGINEERING) STRUCK A 2-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION MAIN (NEAR A 3-WAY TEE, WHICH BRANCHES OFF A 4-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION MAIN) WITH A BACKHOE, CAUSING AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE THIRD PARTY CALLED USA (NO. 459722) ON 11/3/2014.  PG&E RECEIVED THE NORMAL NOTICE ON 11/03/2014 (11:25:55 AM).  IN RESPONSE TO THE TICKET, PG&E ATTEMPTED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE EXCAVATOR BEFORE LOCATING AND MARKING ITS FACILITIES.  PG&E LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THE EXCAVATOR ON 11/5/2014 BUT DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM THE EXCAVATOR TO COORDINATE THE LOCATE AND MARK PRIOR TO THE EXCAVATION. (AS IS CUSTOMARY FOR LARGE EXCAVATION PROJECTS, PG&E COMMUNICATES WITH THE EXCAVATORS TO PHASE THE MARKING OF PG&E FACILITIES TO ENSURE MARKINGS REMAIN VISIBLE IN THE EXCAVATION AREA.) A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (GSR) ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 1131 HOURS. PG&E REPAIR CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1140 HOURS.  GAS WAS COMPLETELY SHUT IN AT 1702 HOURS BY CLOSING 10 DISTRIBUTION MAIN VALVES AND ISOLATING APPROXIMATELY 4 BLOCKS OF THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND 40 CUSTOMERS. PG&E INITIALLY PLANNED TO SAFELY SQUEEZE THE 2-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC PIPE AT A LOCATION AWAY FROM THE PERIPHERY OF THE DIG-IN LOCATION. UPON FURTHER EVALUATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT DIGGING AND SQUEEZING THE LINE WOULD TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME DUE TO THE DEPTH EXCEEDING 5 FEET AND THE NEED TO INSTALL SHORING TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. ONCE PG&E ESTIMATED THE TOTAL TIME REQUIRED FOR THE SHUT-IN, PG&E DECIDED TO LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE THAT INCLUDED CLOSING VALVES IN THE SURROUNDING AREA THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE CUSTOMER OUTAGES.  PG&E DETERMINED THAT CLOSING VALVES WAS THE FASTEST AND SAFEST METHOD AND CHOSE TO CLOSE NEARBY VALVES FOR SHUTTING IN GAS FLOW. REPAIR CREW REPLACED THE 4X4X2-INCH TEE AND THE DAMAGED 2-INCH DISTRIBUTION MAIN. ABOUT 2,500 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM OFFICE BUILDINGS ON A TWO-BLOCK AREA OF MARKET AND FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS. SANTA CLARA STREET WAS CLOSED BETWEEN FIRST AND SAN PEDRO STREETS, ACCORDING TO THE VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. BUS LINES 22, 522, 68, 17, 168, AND 181 WERE REROUTED, VTA OFFICIALS SAID. SEVERAL SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA NEWS STATIONS WERE OBSERVED ON SCENE (I.E., KTVU, NBC BAY AREA). THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE CPUC AND DOT DUE TO THE ESTIMATED DAMAGES EXPECTED TO EXCEED $50,000 AND MAJOR MEDIA OBSERVED ON SCENE."

FPU TECHNICIANS ARRIVED AT 20:57 AND DISCOVERED THE RESIDENCE AT THE ADDRESS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD SHUT OFF THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE METER TO THE RESIDENCE BUT NATURAL GAS WAS STILL FEEDING THE FLAMES.    CREWS FROM FPU STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS IN THE 3"" MAIN ON THE STREET AT THE INTERSECTION OF PRIMAVERA AV AND COCOANUT ROW. THIS STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE HOUSE AT 417 PRIMAVERA AVE. APPROXIMATLEY 25 ADDITIONAL RESIDENCES WERE AFFECTED BY THE FLOW OF GAS BEING STOPPED. THE GAS MAIN IS A 3"" BARE STEEL MAIN OPERATED AT 20 PSIG. THE SERVICE TO 417 PRIMAVERA IS A 3/4"" PE SERVICE OPERATED AT 20 PSIG.     THERE ARE CONFLICTING PRELIMINARY REPORTS OF INJURIES FROM THIS RESIDNECE. THE INCIDENT COMMANDER FROM TOWN OF PALM BEACH  FIRE RESCUE STATED ONE PERSON, A POSSIBLE PROPERTY CARETAKER, AND ONE PALM BEACH COUNTY FIREMAN WERE TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES AND RELEASED AT GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL IN WEST PALM BEACH.

NEITHER OF THESE REPORTS CAN BE CONFIRMED AT THIS TIME (09:19 ON 11/4/14).    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE UPDATE 11/18/14:  THE HOMEOWNER DETECTED LEAKING NATURAL GAS IN THE GARAGE AND EXITED THE GARAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WHEN THE GAS IGNITED FROM UNKOWN SOURCES. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE GAS ESCAPED THE MAIN UNDER THE PAVING IN THE STREET WHERE IT WAS IN CONTACT WITH A STEEL CONDUIT FOR AN AT&T PHONE CALBE AND A STEEL CONDUIT FOR THE ELECTRIC SERVICE TO THE HOUSE. THE ESCAPING GAS TRAVELED THROUGH HOLES IN THE GAS MAIN AND THE PHONE CONDUIT CREATED BY ELECTRICAL ARC BURNS. THE GAS ENTERED 417 PRIMAVERA VIA THE PHONE CONDUIT INTO THE GARAGE.    THREE PERSONS WERE TRANSPORTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL AND ALL WERE EXAMINED AND RELEASED. THE 82 YEAR OLD HOMEOWNER WAS TREATED FOR MINOR INJURIES AND RELEASED. HIS WIFE WAS ALSO CHECKED OUT AND RELEASED. ONE FIREFIGHTER WAS TREATED FOR A KNEE INJURY SUSTAINED WHEN SHE TRIPPED OVER HOSE LINE AND RELEASED.    UPON A PRESSURE TEST OF THE MAIN AND SERVICES ON THE STREET, ADDITIONAL ARC BURNS WERE DETECTED IN A 3/4"" PE SERIVCE IN THE STREET NEAR THE CONDUITS. THE 3"" BS GAS MAIN WAS INSERTED WITH 2"" PE AND THE SERVICES WERE REPAIRED AND ALL THE AFFECTED FACILITIES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AGAIN AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE REMAINING HOUSES ON THE STREET ON 11/6/2014.     AT&T HAS ALSO REPLACED THE PHONE CABLE IN THE STREET AND ABANDONED THE STEEL CONDUIT BY 11/17/2014.    FINAL - UPDATED NARRATIVE 2/25/15  A JOPINT INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY WAS CONDUCTED ON 12/4/2014 BY INVESTIGATORS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT AND FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NATURAL GAS ENTERED THE GARAGE VIA A PHONE CONDUIT. THE GAS IGNITED IN THE GARAGE AND FUELED THE FIRE. IT WAS NOT DETERMINED HOW THE GAS ENTERED THE PHONE CONDUIT. A METALURGICAL INSPECTION OF THE STEEL PHONE CONDUIT AND GAS PIPE THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WILL BE CONDUCTED AT THE FACILITIES OF SEA LIMITED, INC. IN JACKSONVILLE ON 3/17/2015.

THE CREW INSTALLED A NEW SERVICE TEE, TRANSFERRED THE SERVICE CONNECTION AND INSTALLED AN ADAM SLEEVE OVER THE LEAKING SECTION AS A ¿MAKE SAFE¿ TEMPORARY REPAIR.  THEY MONITORED THE LOCATION OVERNIGHT.  THE FOLLOWING DAY (OCTOBER 29TH) THE CREW RETURNED TO THE LOCATION TO MAKE THE PERMANENT REPAIR.  IN ORDER TO PERFORM THE REPAIR, THEY NEEDED TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF MAIN BY APPLYING SQUEEZE OFF DEVICES.  THEY REVIEWED THE NRG MAPS AND CONTACTED GAS CONTROL TO CONFIRM THAT THE MAIN WAS BACK FED.  THE GAS CONTROL OPERATOR UTILIZED THE ¿CONNECTIVITY¿ TOOL IN THE NRG MAPPING SYSTEM AND PANNED TO ABOUT 600 SCALE IN ORDER TO CONFIRM BACKFEED.  SINCE THE ¿CONNECTIVITY¿ TOOL AND A PAN OF THE AREA CONFIRMED THAT THERE WAS A BACKFEED, APPROVAL TO PERFORM THE SQUEEZE OFF WAS GRANTED BY GAS CONTROL.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE ¿CONNECTIVITY¿ TOOL DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE DEAD END OF THE MAIN WHICH IS ABOUT 1.6 MILES FROM THE JOB LOCATION.  FIELD OPS NOR GAS CONTROL IDENTIFIED THE DEADEND IN THE NRG MAPPING SYSTEM WHEN THEY REVIEWED IT BECAUSE TO CAPTURE BOTH THE JOB LOCATION AND THE DEAD END, THE USER WOULD HAVE TO ZOOM OUT TO 900 SCALE. THE CREW INSTALLED AND MONITORED PRESSURE GAUGES PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION OF THE ISOLATION DEVICES (SQUEEZE OFFS).

WAS INSTALLING TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES WITH DIRECTIONAL BORE UNDER N. PITCHER STREET, KALAMAZOO.  DURING THIS WORK, THE CONTRACTOR BORED INTO, AND PUNCTURED, A 6-INCH DIAMETER STEEL HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION GAS MAIN OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 190 PSIG.  THIS PARTICULAR SEGMENT OF MAIN IS ONE OF THE TWO HIGH-PRESSURE FEEDS SERVING GRAPHICS PACKAGING, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS IN THE AREA.    THERE WERE TWO SEPARATE DIG IT DIRECTIONAL BORE CREWS WORKING ON N. PITCHER STREET.  ONE CREW WAS INSTALLING FACILITIES IN PARALLEL TO THE EXISTING HIGH PRESSURE MAIN (NORTH-SOUTH), AND A SECOND CREW WAS WORKING ON LATERALS CROSSING N. PITCHER STREET (WEST-EAST).  THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A WEST-TO-EAST BORE.    THERE WERE FOUND TO BE MULTIPLE MISS DIG STAKING REQUESTS FOR THE AREA.  MISS DIG TICKETS B42820566 AND B4280561 WERE IDENTIFIED FOR STAKING OF THE EAST SIDE OF N. PITCHER STREET, STARTING AT THE INTERSECTION WITH MOSEL AVENUE AND HEADING SOUTH FOR 2,500 FEET.  THIS AREA INCLUDES THE DAMAGE LOCATION AND APPROXIMATELY 2,000 FEET TO THE NORTH OF DAMAGE.  TWO ADDITIONAL MISS DIG TICKETS (B42820548 AND B42820550) WERE IDENTIFIED FOR STAKING BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD FROM 1819 N. PITCHER STREET TO THE NORTH, FOR APPROXIMATELY 600 FEET.  THIS AREA IS IMMEDIATELY TO THE SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE LOCATION.    WHILE STAKING WAS EVIDENT BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE DAMAGE LOCATION, THE MARKINGS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE DAMAGE (WITHIN 5 FEET) WERE APPARENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALERT THE CREW OF THE GAS MAIN'S PRESENCE.    THE DAMAGE LOCATION IS IN A RELATIVELY UNCONGESTED COMMERCIAL AREA.

THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED ON SITE, CONDUCTED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE AREA AND CONCLUDED THAT GAS WAS NOT MIGRATING AND ACCORDING TO AVAILABLE DATA DID NOT BELIEVE THE LEAK TO BE ON A DOMINION FACILITY.  THE TECHNICIAN NOTIFIED THE FIRE CHIEF OF HIS FINDINGS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:55 P.M. DOMINION WAS NOTIFIED BY THE EPA THAT OIL WAS BUBBLING UP FROM THE GROUND AND THAT THEY WERE PICKING UP HIGH NATURAL GAS READINGS.  ANOTHER TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE, ARRIVED AT 12:47 A.M. ON 10/2/2014, AND UPON INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT DEO'S 30"" DISTRIBUTION LINE WAS LEAKING AND CALLED IN FOR A CONSTRUCTION CREW.  THE TECHNICIAN CONTINUED TO LEAK SURVEY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  AS ADDITIONAL DOMINION PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE, THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED AND DETERMINED THAT THE LINE WAS DEEPER THAN A DOMINION CREW COULD HANDLE, THEREFORE A CONTRACTING CREW WAS MOBILIZED.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 A.M. DOMINION'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACTORS ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP ACTIVITIES.  THE AREA WAS EVACUATED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M.  AS MEASURE OF SAFETY, BEFORE EXCAVATING COULD OCCUR DOMINION DECIDED TO LOWER THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM THE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED FROM 155 PSIG TO 60 PSIG.  ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS STABILIZED DOMINION BEGAN EXCAVATING.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 P.M. A CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND PRESSURE RESTORED.      THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS CUT OUT AND SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR A 3RD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE RESULTS OF THE TEST CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS A THROUGH-WALL INTERNAL CORROSION PIT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  TEST RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MICROBIAL-INDUCED CORROSION (MIC) PLAYED A ROLE IN THE PITTING CORROSION.  DOMINION REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET OF THE 30"" HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION LINE THAT LEAKED AND WILL REPLACE ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF ADJACENT PIPELINES THROUGHOUT 2015."

CONSTRUCTION, A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR CENTERPOINT ENERGY, WAS IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING AN EXISTING ¾"" STEEL SERVICE LINE TO AN INACTIVE ACCOUNT AT 37 KNIGHT DRIVE, NORTH LITTLE ROCK, AR.  A LOCATE WAS REQUESTED FROM THE ARKANSAS ONE CALL CENTER TO LOCATED ALL FACILITIES; HOWEVER THE CONTRACTOR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING THE CENTERPOINT ENERGY FACILITIES.  EMPLOYEES OF J.F CONSTRUCTION USED A PIPE LOCATOR TO VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE EXISTING SERVICE, FOUND IT TO NOT BE IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR PLANNED WORK, BUT DID NOT COMPLETELY MARK THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE.  DUE TO THE LARGE TREES ON THE PROPERTY, THE ORIGINAL SERVICE LINE INSTALLATION DID NOT TAKE A PERPENDICULAR PATH FROM THE MAIN.  A PNEUMATIC BORING TOOL WAS PLACED IN A BELL HOLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSTALLING A NEW SERVICE.  AFTER BORING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, THE TOOL STRUCK WHAT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE EXISTING SERVICE LINE. THE IMPACT FROM THE BORING TOOL BENT THE ¾¿ STEEL SERVICE LINE AT THE IMPACT POINT, CAUSING A PARTIAL SEPARATION OF THE PIPE AT A THREADED COUPLING SIX FEET EAST OF THE MOBILE HOME AND ANOTHER LEAK OF UNDETERMINED NATURE UNDER THE MOBILE HOME. APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AFTER THE LEAK BEGAN, A SMALL EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AND THE RESULTING FLASH CAUSED SECOND-DEGREE BURNS TO THE RESIDENT INSIDE THE MOBILE HOME.  HYDRAULIC SQUEEZE TOOLS WERE USED TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS AND TO RETIRE/ABANDON THE SERVICE LINE. THE PIPELINE FACILITY (SERVICE LINE) REMAINS SHUT DOWN. HOWEVER, INSTALLATION OF A NEW SERVICE IS NOT ANTICIPATED. THEREFORE, WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO FILE A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.   CENTERPOINT ENERGY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS FROM THIS INCIDENT. WE ANTICIPATE ALL ASSOCIATED COSTS TO BE BORNE BY THE CONTRACTOR.

ALTHOUGH NATURAL GAS IS ONE POTENTIAL SOURCE OF THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE; IT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED THAT NATURAL GAS WAS THE SOURCE OF THE EXPLOSION.      ON APRIL 25, 2014 AT 2222 HOURS, A NORTH SHORE GAS EMPLOYEE ARRIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE EVENT. THE EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO 4777 WELLINGTON DRIVE TO COMPLETE A LEAK INVESTIGATION ORDER THAT WAS CREATED AT 2152 HOURS. DURING THE LEAK INVESTIGATION, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR AT THE CORNER OF WELLINGTON DRIVE AND TRENTON COURT AND DETECTED 0.3% LEL WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI).    THE EMPLOYEE NOTICED FERTILIZER AND MULCH IN THE AREA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES AND TRAINING, THE EMPLOYEE ATTACHED A CHARCOAL FILTER TO THE CGI AND DETECTED 0.0% LEL WITH THE FILTER INSTALLED. THE EMPLOYEE WALKED TOWARDS 4773 TRENTON COURT WHEN THE RESIDENT OF THE AREA FLAGGED THE EMPLOYEE DOWN AND SHOUTED THAT THERE IS A FIRE IN THE RESIDENCE NEXT DOOR. THE EMPLOYEE STARTED TO DIAL 911 AND 4771 TRENTON COURT EXPLODED AT APPROXIMATELY 2243 HOURS.    NORTH SHORE GAS STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS BY CLOSING A SINGLE VALVE AT 0032 HOURS ON APRIL 26, 2014 AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LONG GROVE FIRE DEPARTMENT. TWO PEOPLE RECEIVED MEDICAL ATTENTION ONSITE AND WERE RELEASED. OTHER HOMES IN THE AREA WERE DAMAGED DUE TO THE EXPLOSION AND THE EXTENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    THE GAS MAIN THAT FED 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 2"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1991. THE GAS SERVICE FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT IS A 1.125"" BLACK PLASTIC SERVICE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1996. THE SERVICE DID NOT HAVE AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE AS IT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY CODE AT THE TIME OF INSTALLATION. FOLLOWING THE EVENT, THE GAS MAIN AND ALL ASSOCIATED GAS SERVICE PIPES WERE PRESSURE TESTED ON MAY 12, 2014.  THE MAINS AND SERVICES WERE PRESSURE TESTED AT 44 PSIG, THE PRESSURE IN THE LINES AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION FOR 1 HOUR.  ALL MAINS AND SERVICES HELD PRESSURE DEMONSTRATING NO LEAKAGE OUT OF THESE LINES. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION (ICC) PIPELINE SAFETY BRANCH WITNESSED THIS TESTING. THE 4"" BLACK PLASTIC DIRECT BURIED MAIN IN WELLINGTON DRIVE WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS ON APRIL 27, 2014.    THE RISER FOR 4771 TRENTON COURT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE ON MAY 15, 2014 FOR AN X-RAY AND IS SCHEDULED TO BE PERFORMED ON MAY 23, 2014. THE METER AND REGULATOR ARE NOT IN A CONDITION THAT CAN BE TESTED.    JUNE 4, 2014 UPDATE: THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND CANNOT BE CLOSED AT THIS TIME. AN X-RAY TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE RISER PIPE ON MAY 23, 2014 TO TEST THE MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY. THE FINAL RESULTS SHOULD BE RECEIVED SHORTLY. IN ADDITION, A CT SCAN AND DESTRUCTIVE TEST WILL BE PERFORMED IN THE NEXT MONTH. NSG AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARE PLANNING TO COORDINATE LESSONS LEARNED DURING THE INCIDENT RESPONSE.    SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 UPDATE: THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND CANNOT BE CLOSED AT THIS TIME. THE RESULTS FROM X-RAY/CT SCAN OF THE RISER THAT TOOK PLACE ON MAY 23, 2014 AND THE GROUND PENETRATION RADAR COMPILATION OF THE SITE CONDUCTED ON JUNE 11, 2014 WERE INCONCLUSIVE. A BORESCOPE OF THE RISER IS SCHEDULE FOR OCTOBER 10, 2014. THE 2"" PLASTIC MEDIUM PRESSURE MAIN IN TRENTON COURT WAS AIR TESTED FOR 1 HOUR AND GASSED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 TO RESTART SERVICE TO NEIGHBORING HOMES.    DECEMBER 31, 2014 UPDATE: THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE BORESCOPE PERFORMED ON OCTOBER 10, 2014 WAS INCONCLUSIVE. ON NOVEMBER 3, 2014, THE RISER ASSEMBLY WAS PRESSURE TESTED AND DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE DUE TO EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC PIPE INSIDE THE RISER. THE HOME APPLIANCES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING TESTED.    MARCH 31, 2015 UPDATE: THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE HOME APPLIANCES WAS INCONCLUSIVE."

UPON ARRIVAL, THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SITE AND CONTROLLING THE SCENE.  NATURAL GAS APPEARED TO BE RELEASING IN THE GENERAL AREA OF THE GAS METER.  THE GAS WAS CONTROLLED BY SQUEEZE-OFF OF THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE AT 11:08 AM.  WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL CONDUCTED BAR/TEST IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT AND OBSERVED NO EVIDENCE OF GAS MIGRATION.  AN ODORANT SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AND THE LEVEL OF ODORANT WAS DETERMINED TO BE ACCEPTABLE.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE FROM THE SQUEEZE-OFF POINT TO THE UPPER END OF THE STEEL SERVICE RISER.  THE PRESSURE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT OPERATING PRESSURE FOR 15 MINUTES.  THE SERVICE HELD THE PRESSURE TEST.  A FRACTURE WAS OBSERVED AT THE THREADED END OF THE RISER IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE STOPCOCK.  FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS OF THE THREADED END OF THE RISER INDICATED THAT THE FRACTURE OF THE STEEL PIPE WAS CAUSED BY THE APPLICATION OF A SINGLE HIGH LOAD EXCEEDING THE FRACTURE STRENGTH OF THE STEEL. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT ENVIRONMENT OR FATIGUE LOADING CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FAILURE.  UPON GAINING ACCESS TO THE MOBILE HOME ON 5/5/2014, WASHINGTON GAS CONDUCTED A PRESSURE TEST ON THE REMAINING HOUSE LINES UNDER THE OBSERVATION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL.  THE HOUSE LINE TO THE STOVE WAS FRACTURED AND THE STOVE WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE FLOOR LEVEL OF THE MOBILE HOME.  THIS LINE WAS CAPPED TO PERFORM THE PRESSURE TEST.  THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT 10 INCHES OF WATER COLUMN FOR 13 MINUTES.  THE HOUSE LINES HELD THE PRESSURE TEST.  THE FRACTURED LINE TO THE STOVE WAS REMOVED FOR ANALYSIS.  AT THIS TIME, THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IS ONGOING.  THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE MARSHAL REPORT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS UNDETERMINED.

AT 20:26, DTE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND CONFIRMED THE EXPLOSION AND REPORTED THE GAS METER WAS ON FIRE.   AT 21:50, DTE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS TESTED FOR LEAKS BETWEEN THE MAIN NEAR THE STREET TO THE METER ASSEMBLY AT THE OUTSIDE BUILDING WALL USING AIR AT A PRESSURE OF 2 PSIG FOR DURATION OF 10 MINUTES.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS FOUND TO BE AIR-TIGHT AS A RESULT OF THIS TEST, DEMONSTRATING THE SERVICE LINE WAS NOT LEAKING PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.  DTE GAS PERFORMED UNDERGROUND LEAK CHECKS OVER THE SERVICE LINES AND THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN IN THE AREA AROUND 19717 FAIRPORT; THERE WERE TRACE INDICATIONS OVER THE MAIN OF 0.5% GAS IN AIR, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THERE WERE NO READINGS ALONG THE SERVICE LINE BETWEEN THE MAIN AND THE RESIDENCE.  AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOCKED SERVICE VALVE AT THE OUTSIDE METER MANIFOLD WAS BROKEN AND TURNED ON BY AN UNAUTHORIZED PERSON(S).  DTE GAS RECORDS INDICATED ON FEBRUARY 18, 2014, THE ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICE WERE TURNED OFF AT THE REQUEST OF PROPERTY OWNER OF RECORD.  ON MARCH 26, 2014, ONLY THE ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED AS REQUESTED BY THE PROPERTY OWNER.     THERE WERE NO FATALITIES; HOWEVER FOUR ADULTS AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THE EXPLOSION.  THE PROPERTY OWNER STATED THERE WAS NO LANDLORD/TENANT AGREEMENT AT THIS LOCATION.  THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS UNDETERMINED AT THIS TIME AND THE TRACE INDICATIONS WOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPLOSION."

SW IN CARMEL.  A PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC (PG&E) CONSTRUCTION CREW TAPPED INTO A 2-INCH DIAMETER STEEL MAIN AND INADVERTENTLY TAPPED THROUGH THE 1¼-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN INSERTED IN THE 2-INCH STEEL MAIN.  THE CREW WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE 1¼-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN INSERTED INTO THE 2-INCH DIAMETER STEEL LINE.  THE CAUSAL EVALUATION OF THE INCIDENT PERFORMED BY A THIRD PARTY INVESTIGATOR DETERMINED THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION TO BE ""INADEQUATE VERIFICATION OF SYSTEM STATUS AND CONFIGURATION WHEN PERFORMING WORK ON A LIVE LINE.""  PG&E HAS DETERMINED THAT GAS MOST LIKELY ESCAPED FROM THE 1¼-INCH DIAMETER PLASTIC MAIN AND MIGRATED INTO A SEPARATED SEWER LATERAL THAT PROVIDED A PATH INTO THE HOUSE.  NO ONE WAS IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  A PG&E GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS ON SITE AT 1135 HOURS.  PG&E REPAIR CREWS WERE ON SITE AT 1138 HOURS.  THE HOUSE WAS NOT OCCUPIED AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION, AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED THE HOMES IN A 1-BLOCK RADIUS.  DEBRIS FROM THE EXPLOSION FELL ONTO THE ROOF OF A NEIGHBORING HOUSE, AND GAS SERVICE TO THAT HOUSE WAS SHUT OFF AS A PRECAUTION.  THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED AT 1145 HOURS BY SQUEEZING THE MAIN AT TWO LOCATIONS.  THE REPAIR CREW ALSO DUG UP AND SQUEEZED THE SERVICE LINE TO THE DAMAGED HOUSE.  THE GAS MAIN WAS THEN CAPPED AT 1209 HOURS.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE DOT AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DUE TO PROPERTY DAMAGES EXCEEDING $50,000.  PG&E CONDUCTED A SPECIAL LEAK SURVEY AFTER THE INCIDENT, AND ONE LEAK ON A SERVICE VALVE IN THE VICINITY WAS FOUND AND REPAIRED.  SERVICE TO THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE WAS RESTORED ON 3/11/2014 BY THE HOMEOWNER'S CONTRACTOR WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO PG&E, HOWEVER, AFTER THE OCCUPANTS INFORMED PG&E ON 3/12/2014, PG&E PERFORMED A SERVICE SHUT DOWN AND RESTART ON 3/12/2014, INCLUDING A PRESSURE CHECK, A SOAP TEST, AND A SAFETY CHECK OF ALL THE GAS APPLIANCES IN THE HOME."

PIN BAR TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE METER, WHERE 15% GAS READS WERE FOUND.  ADDITIONAL BAR TESTING REVEALED SUSTAINED 95% GAS READS AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND 100% GAS READS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET WEST OF THE HOUSE NEAR THE ROAD.  A STRONG GAS ODOR WAS EVIDENT IN THIS LOCATION.  FIRST RESPONDERS THEN TOOK GAS READINGS INSIDE THE BASEMENT AFTER BEING ESCORTED IN BY THE FIRE MARSHALL.    BAR TESTING AT ADJACENT HOUSES (SOUTH AND WEST OF 2754 WILDER) PRODUCED NO GAS READS.    AT 1:42 AM ON MARCH 1, A GAS DISTRIBUTION CREW ARRIVED AND EXPOSED THE 2 INCH STEEL MAIN IN FRONT OF (WEST OF) 2754 WILDER.  THE MAIN WAS BENT, CRACKED AND LEAKING.  THE CREW OPENED UP THE HOLE TO VENT THE BLOWING GAS.  A FROST BALL ON THE LEAK WAS KNOCKED OFF AT 5:45 AM, AT WHICH POINT THE GAS BEGAN BLOWING.  AT 9:20 AM, A 2"" PLIDCO REPAIR SLEEVE, WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK AND REPAIRED THE MAIN. INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS DAMAGE DURING INSTALLATION OF A WATER MAIN; THE EXACT TIME PERIOD OF THE WATER MAIN INSTALLATION IS UNKNOWN. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE OBSERVED DAMAGE AND PROXIMITY OF THE WATER MAIN. THE LOCATION OF THE MAIN LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE HOUSE. A SEARCH OF MISS DIG STAKING REQUESTS FOR THIS LOCATION DID NOT YIELD ANY RECENT STAKING TICKETS WITHIN THE LAST 15 MONTHS.    THE ORIGIN OF THE HOUSEFIRE WAS APPARENTLY THE BASEMENT OF THE HOME.  ALTHOUGH AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATOR REPRESENTING THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE COMPANY (STATE FARM) INDICATED THAT THE GAS LEAK MAY HAVE CAUSED THE FIRE, FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION BY CONSUMERS ENERGY INDICATES THAT THIS SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF AN EXPLOSION OR INDEED IGNITION OF GAS IN THE HOME, AND WHILE THERE WERE EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF GAS DETECTED IN THE BASEMENT BY FIRST RESPONDERS (0.16% GAS READS, OR 4% LEL), THIS SEEMS TO HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ALL DOORS AND WINDOWS (INCLUDING THOSE IN THE BASEMENT) BEING OPENED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THE HOME FROM OUTSIDE.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT CRACKS OR HOLES IN THE BASEMENT WALL WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PROVIDE A PATH OF MIGRATION INTO THE HOME, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE METER OR THE STEEL GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME.  FURTHERMORE, THE MAJORITY OF FIRE DAMAGE WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE BASEMENT (THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE GAS FACILITIES)    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF ON SITE WAS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO COME TO A DETERMINATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSEFIRE.  DUE TO THE LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SOURCE OF FIRE, AS WELL AS PROPERTY DAMAGE WITHIN THE HOME (DAMAGES TO APPLIANCES AND SMOKE DAMAGE) LIKELY EXCEEDING $50,000, THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. DAMAGE ESTIMATES FROM THE FIRE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS INVESTIGATORS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY $50,000 TO $110,000; INSURANCE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES STATED THAT THE HOME WAS INSURED TO A VALUE OF $160,000."

GAS CREWS RESPONDED AND CONFIRMED LEAKAGE AND THAT THE WATER HAD ENTERED THE GAS MAIN.  THE WATER CREWS ISOLATED THE WATER MAIN AT THE INCURSION POINT AND SOCALGAS EXCAVATED AND REPAIRED THE GAS LEAK WITH A CLAMP.  WHILE THE GAS LEAK WAS BEING BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL, SOCALGAS BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE AREA TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE WATER INCURSION.  NUMEROUS LOCATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED DUE TO LOW ELEVATION AND ENDS OF THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AS WATER EXTRACTION POINTS.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE DAYS, APPROXIMATELY 6,100 GALLONS OF WATER WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE GAS LINES AND 1,751 IMPACTED METERS WERE REPLACED.

INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE WATER MAIN, LOCATED PERPENDICULAR TO AND DIRECTLY ABOVE THE GAS MAIN HAD A CORROSION LEAK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE.  THAT WATER LEAK, OVER TIME, BORED A HOLE INTO THE TOP OF THE GAS MAIN.  THE WATER PRESSURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 PSIG AND THE GAS WAS OPERATING AT 45 PSIG WHICH ALLOWED THE WATER TO ENTER THE GAS MAIN.  THE GAS MAIN WAS REPAIRED WITH A CLAMP, THE WATER MAIN WAS REPLACED AT THE CROSSING.      THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO PHMSA DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED COSTS OF THE INCIDENT WOULD EXCEED $50,000.

NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO PHMSA VIA THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) REPORT NUMBER 1073454 AT 19:35 OF THE IN-PATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.  THERE WERE NO FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT FOUND THE LEAK TO HAVE OCCURRED ON A 1"" PE SERVICE STUB.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK ON THE 1"" PE LINE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION BY SWG.    NOTE: FOR PART A, #10, THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED THAT IS IDENTIFIED REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE THAT PRESUMES A CRACK THAT IS LEAKING AT 57 PSI, BEGINNING AT THE TIME OF THE INTIAL REPORT OF THE INCIDENT AND ENDING AT THE TIME THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF GAS LOSS IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE TIME THE GAS PIPELINE BEGAN LEAKING IS UNKNOWN."

BANCROFT STREET.  AN FSD TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE THIS LEAK.  HE ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 17:29 AND BEGAN HIS INVESTIGATION.  A READING OF 70% LEL AT THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL TO 1845 S. BANCROFT WAS REPORTED BY THE TECHNICIAN TO THE FSD DISPATCHER.  BASED ON THIS REPORT, A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS DISPATCHED AT 18:10.  FSD AND DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISION WERE ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION.  THE CREW ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT 18:24 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WHILE THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND THE FSD TECHNICIAN WERE INSIDE THE PROPERTY AT 1849 S. BANCROFT CHECKING FOR GAS READINGS, AN EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 INSIDE 1849 S. BANCROFT.  THE EXPLOSION SEVERELY DAMAGED THE TWO RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AT 1849 AND 1847 S. BANCROFT.  IT ALSO INJURED BOTH PGW EMPLOYEES WHO WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE, AS WELL AS ONE HOMEOWNER.  THE INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ALL THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE NON-LIFE THREATENING.  BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION FOREMAN AND HOMEOWNER WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT AND RELEASED ON THE SAME DAY WHILE THE FSD TECHNICIAN WAS ADMITTED WITH BURNS TO HIS NECK AND LOWER TORSO.  THE EXPLOSION AT THE SCENE WAS OBSERVED BY A FSD SUPERVISOR WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 19:05.  PHILADELPHIA FIRE DEPARTMENT, PHILADELPHIA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND PECO ENERGY WERE CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS PGW RESOURCES SUCH AS, DISTRIBUTION CREWS, FSD TECHNICIANS, MOBILE EQUIPMENT, GREASE TRUCK, SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL, CHEMICAL SERVICES, ETC.  THE PAPUC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.    A DEAD END GAS MAIN THAT WAS INSTALLED IN THE EAST FOOTWAY IN FRONT OF 1849 S. BANCROFT (4"" 1939 LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON MAIN) WAS GREASED OFF THROUGH A PLASTIC SERVICE TO 1843 S. BANCROFT AT 19:51 AND THE LEAK CONSEQUENTLY WAS MADE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GREASING OFF, A TOTAL OF FOUR (4) PROPERTIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS.  PECO ALSO SHUT OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER TO 1849 S. BANCROFT AT 21:00.  AFTER MAKING THE JOB SAFE AND RECEIVING THE GO AHEAD FROM PFD, PGW PERSONNEL ON THE SCENE CONTINUED WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  EVERY BUILDING ON THE 1800 BLOCK OF S. BANCROFT WAS CHECKED FOR GAS READINGS.  ALSO, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK ALONG WITH ALL ACTIVE GAS SERVICES WERE BAR HOLED IN ORDER TO CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS.  DURING THIS BLOCK CHECK THE CREW PICKED UP LEL READINGS IN FRONT OF 1835 AND 1816/1818.  A BROKEN MAIN WAS EVENTUALLY FOUND AND REPAIRED IN FRONT OF 1818 AND A TOTAL OF SIX (6) SERVICES ON THE BLOCK WERE RENEWED WITH PLASTIC.  THE GREASED 4"" MAIN WAS ALSO CUT AND CAPPED AT 03:45.  THIS PORTION OF THE 4"" MAIN THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED (100') WAS AIR TESTED AT 6"" WC AND THE TEST FAILED.  THIS SECTION OF THE MAIN WAS THEN EXCAVATED COMPLETELY AND A BROKEN MAIN WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 1849.  AN 8' SECTION OF THE PIPE, CONTAINING THE BROKEN MAIN, WAS CUT AND REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION, TAGGED AS EVIDENCE AND TRANSPORTED TO THE PGW EVIDENCE ROOM ON 1/31/2014.  THE SERVICES TO 1845 AND 1847 (BOTH 1 1/4"" UNPROTECTED STEEL SERVICES) WERE ALSO AIR TESTED AND FAILED.  AFTER THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED, THE GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE SHUT OFF DURING THE GREASE OFF PROCESS.  THE BUILDING AT 1849 THAT WAS DAMAGED BY THE EXPLOSION WAS DEMOLISHED BY THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA ON 2/1/2014.  FINALLY, THE 4"" CAST IRON MAIN ON THE BLOCK WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED WITH PLASTIC BY PGW OVER THE FOLLOWING TWO WEEKS."

THE CALLER STATED THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO GAS BURNING. WE ENERGIES IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SITE.  THE FIRST RESPONDER ARRIVED ON SITE AT 11:47 A.M. AND OBSERVED A STRUCTURE FIRE; BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF AN EXPLOSION. THE EMPLOYEE NOTED THAT THE STRUCTURE FIRE WAS ESSENTIALLY UNDER CONTROL BUT NATURAL GAS WAS BURNING AT THE OUTSIDE METER AND AT A FEW LOCATIONS ON THE GROUND NEAR THE BUILDING. THE FIRST RESPONDER SAW THAT MORE RESOURCES WERE NEEDED TO REMOTELY SHUT OFF THE GAS AND MADE THE REQUEST TO THE DISPATCHER. THE FIRST RESPONDER AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WHO HAD ARRIVED PROCEEDED TO CHECK FOR GAS MIGRATION AND WORK WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO KEEP A SAFE PERIMETER. INITIAL PROBING AND RECHECKS VERIFIED THAT GAS WAS ONLY IN THE AREA OF THE STRUCTURE FIRE.  AT ABOUT 12:52 P.M., MORE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND BEGAN DIGGING TO REMOTELY SQUEEZE OFF GAS ON THIS ONE-WAY FEED TO 2800 LAKESHORE WAY AND THE PROPERTY TO THE NORTH. A FROST DEPTH OF ABOUT 3 FT. MADE EXCAVATION HARD, AND THE 1958-INSTALLED 1 ¼ IN. STEEL GAS MAIN TO THE PROPERTIES WAS SQUEEZED OFF AT ABOUT 3:09 P.M. ALL FIRE AT THE PROPERTY WAS EXTINGUISHED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  TO CONFIRM THE UNOCCUPIED HOME TO THE NORTH WAS SAFE, ACCESS WAS GAINED WITH POLICE ASSISTANCE AT ABOUT 1:30 P.M. AND ALL THREE LEVELS CHECKED AT 0%.  DUE TO THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE POTENTIALLY CAUSED BY GAS LEAKAGE FROM OPERATOR FACILITIES, A PHONE NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT ABOUT 4:00 P.M. TO REPORT THIS EVENT AS A POSSIBLE INCIDENT PER 49 CFR PART 191.3. THE WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (WPSC) WAS ALSO NOTIFIED.  A LINE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY BY ABOUT 6:30 P.M. ON 1/30/14. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THE SITE WAS SAFE, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY TO CONDUCT FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  ON 1/31/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE FOR INVESTIGATIONS. INITIAL PRESSURE TESTING OF THE ABANDONED MAIN AND SERVICE INDICATED AN UNDERGROUND LEAK, AND IT WAS BELIEVED NECESSARY TO EXCAVATE AT THE SERVICE TEE. SINCE THE PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH MOVING NECESSARY PERSONAL PROPERTY, FURTHER EXCAVATION WAS DELAYED UNTIL FEBRUARY 4TH.  ON 2/4/14, TWIN LAKES FIRE, WPSC AND COMPANY PERSONNEL MET ON SITE TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. UPON EXCAVATION AT THE SERVICE TEE LOCATION FOR 2800 LAKESHORE WAY, A BENT SECTION OF MAIN WAS IDENTIFIED. THE MAIN WAS BENT IN AN ARC, AND WAS DISPLACED VERTICALLY BY ABOUT 3 IN. OVER A 6 FT. LENGTH. THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED AND A CRACK WAS FOUND IN THE BENT SECTION OF THE PIPE. IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE DAMAGE OCCURRED DURING A PRIOR EXCAVATION AND THAT MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE DEEP FROST LEVELS OBSERVED THIS WINTER CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE. ONE-CALL CENTER RECORDS DO NOT INDICATE ANY RECENT LOCATE TICKET REQUESTS AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE EXCAVATION ACTIVITY THAT DAMAGED THE PIPE OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO.  A NEW PE MAIN WAS INSTALLED ON LAKESHORE WAY AND GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED PROPERTY WAS RESTORED ON 2/14/14.  A FORMAL INCIDENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON 2/21/14. PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVIEW INCLUDED GAS DISTRIBUTION WORKERS AT THE SCENE AFTER THE FIRE WAS REPORTED AND OTHER COMPANY PERSONNEL WHO ASSISTED AT THE SCENE. PIPELINE SAFETY ENGINEERS FROM THE WPSC, ONE OF WHOM HAD INSPECTED THE SITE THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE, ALSO ATTENDED. THE REVIEW RECOUNTED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND INCLUDED COMMUNICATIONS CONDUCTED AMONG INVOLVED PERSONNEL.  WE ENERGIES IS PERFORMING MORE LEAK SURVEYS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED IN CFR 49, PART 192 ON SIMILAR TYPE FACILITIES BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME WINTER CONDITIONS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY."

UPON ARRIVAL THE FD WAS MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE FIRE BURNING IN THE YARD NEAR THE SIDE WALK WHERE THE SERVICE WAS LOCATED AND HAD EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE TO THE HOUSE.  SOCALGAS EXCAVATED AND PINCHED THE SERVICE TO STOP THE GAS FLOW.  A SO CAL EDISON CREW WORKING NEAR THE RESIDENCE REPORTED THAT HIGH WINDS HAD CAUSED TWO POWER LINES TO COME IN CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.  THE EDISON CREW SAID THIS CAUSED THE NEARBY TRANSFORMER TO BLOW CAUSING 12,000 VOLTS TO GO TO GROUND.  THE CUSTOMER OF THE INVOLVED RESIDENCE REPORTED THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE (PRESUMABLY THE TRANSFORMER) AND THE LIGHTS INSIDE THE HOME FLASHED OFF AND ON BEFORE FINALLY REMAINING OFF.  A NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR KNOCKED ON THEIR DOOR AND ADVISED THAT THEIR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND TO GET OUT.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.      AFTER EXCAVATING THE RESIDENCE'S SERVICE LINE, A ½"" DIAMETER HOLE WAS FOUND IN THE BOTTOM OF THE ¾"" STEEL SERVICE LINE NEAR THE AREA WHERE THE FIRE HAD BEEN LOCATED.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS ¼"" ABOVE A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND THE ELECTRICITY LIKELY ARCED BETWEEN THESE TWO LINES CAUSING THE DAMAGE.  A CROSS-SECTION OF THE SERVICE LINE SHOWED THE STEEL WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.     SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED TO THIS ADDRESS AS THE HOME OWNER IS MAKING REPAIRS FROM THE FIRE DAMAGE.  SERVICE WILL BE RESTORED ONCE REQUESTED.      IN ADDITION TO THIS LOCATION, THE SURROUNDING AREA WAS LEAK SURVEYED ON JAN 14TH, TO ENSURE NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGE HAD OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS ELECTRICAL INCIDENT.  A MINOR LEAK WAS DETECTED ON A ¾"" STEEL SERVICE IN THE PARKWAY OF 407 ACACIA AVE IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE DAMAGED TRANSFORMER.  HOWEVER, IT IS NOT RELATED TO THIS ELECTRICAL INCIDENT AND WAS REPAIRED BY MEANS OF A CLAMP JAN 15TH.

THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT 01:55.  THE METER WAS ALREADY SHUT OFF WHEN THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  AT 02:03, THE ASSISTANT FIRE CHIEF INFORMED THE OPERATIONS TECHNICIAN THAT WATER WAS BUBBLING UP AROUND THE SERVICE RISER AT THE BUILDING (A POSSIBLE INDICATOR OF LEAKING GAS).  IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE OPERATIONS TECHNICIAN TO GET CLOSE TO THE BUILDING TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER BECAUSE OF THE FIRE.  INVESTIGATION IF IMMEDIATE SURROUNDING AREA SHOWED NO INDICATION OF A GAS LEAK.  DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, IT WAS DETERMINED BY GAS COMPANY EMPLOYEE AND LOCAL SUPERVISION TO RETIES THE SERVICE TO THE BUILDING AT 802 COMMERCE DR.  COMPANY CREW WAS DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 02:45.  AT 04:24, THE SERVICE LINE WAS RETIRED, SHUTTING OFF GAS SUPPLY TO THE BUILDING AT 802 COMMERCE DR.  FIRE MARSHAL REPORT WAS UNAVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  ON PART A, NUMBER 14, OF THIS REPORT, THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION INDICATES THAT THE GAS DID IGNITE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL WHILE FIGHTING A STRUCTURE FIRE NOTICED A SMALL FLAME COMING FROM AROUND THE SERVICE RISER AND METER SET (OUTSIDE THE FOUNDATION OF THE STRUCTURE) IT WAS EXTINGUISHED IMMEDIATELY,  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ADVISED THE BLACK HILLS ENERGY EMPLOYEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  THE AREA OF THE SERVICE RISER WAS MONITORED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL UNTIL THE GAS SERVICE WAS DUG UP AND CAPPED OFF AT THE MAIN.  THE GAS SERVICE RISER AND METERSET HAVE NOT BEEN REMOVED OR DUG UP BECAUSE OF DEEP GROUND FROST AND FEAR OF DAMAGE CAUSED TO THE RISER AND METER SET.  WE DO PLAN TO EXPOSE THE AREA WHEN CONDITIONS PERMIT.  THE DECORAH FIRE CHIEF WAS TOLD BY THE FIRE MARSHAL THAT THE OFFICIAL REPORT WON¿T BE AVAILABLE FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS.  THE INITIAL FINDING BY THE FIRE MARSHAL IS THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THE STRUCTURE FIRE WAS UNDETERMINED, BUT BELIEVES NATURAL GAS WAS NOT A FACTOR IN THE STRUCTURE FIRE.

THE CREW HAD INSTALLED A 2 INCH PLASTIC BYPASS AROUND THE LEAK AND HAD SQUEEZED OFF THE 4 INCH MAIN TO STOP OFF THE GAS. WHILE PREPARING FOR THE MAIN CUT OUT OF 4 INCH PLASTIC, A SUDDEN RUSH OF GAS OCCURRED AND THEN THE GAS IGNITED CAUSING A FIRE TO OCCUR IN THE EXCAVATION. THERE WERE 2 EMPLOYEES IN THE EXCAVATION WHO WERE ABLE TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THE HOLE JUST BEFORE THE IGNITION OCCURRED. ONE OF THESE EMPLOYEES DID RECEIVE SOME BURNS AND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED FROM A HOSPITAL. THE RESULTING FIRE ALSO SPREAD TO AN NSTAR BACKHOE PARKED AT THE EXCAVATION. THE SHREWSBURY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO CONTROL THE GAS FIRE. AT 1:50 PM A MAIN VALVE ON COLONIAL DR. WAS SHUT TO STOP THE LEAKING GAS AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. THIS RESULTED IN AN OUTAGE TO 135 CUSTOMERS. NSTAR HAD TO REPLACE ABOUT 20 FEET OF 4 INCH PLASTIC MAIN DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE.

AT AROUND 8:30 AM, A CASS LAKE SCHOOL SYSTEM EMPLOYEE NOTED GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE RELIEF VALVE AT THE CASS LAKE HIGH SCHOOL.  HE REPORTED THIS TO HIS SUPERVISOR, PETE RAIRDON (AT HOME AT THE TIME).  MR. TOLD HIS EMPLOYEE THAT HE ( MR. RAIRDON) WAS ON HIS WAY TO HELP AND ALSO INSTRUCTED HIS EMPLOYEE TO CALL THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN CASE THE PROBLEM WAS MORE THAN THE TWO OF THEM COULD HANDLE.    AT 9:12 AM JACK PALKKI (NW GAS ON-CALL TECHNICIAN) RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CASS COUNTY SHERIFF¿S DEPARTMENT DISPATCHER THAT THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON-SITE AT THE CASS LAKE HIGH SCHOOL AND THAT THERE WAS AN OUTDOOR GAS LEAK REPORTED.  JACK ASKED FOR AN ON-SITE CONTACT NUMBER WHICH HE WAS GIVEN AND WHEN HE MADE CONTACT WITH THE ON-SITE PERSONNEL LEARNED THAT THE GAS WAS NOW OFF AND THE SITUATION AT THE SCHOOL WAS SAFE.    JACK THEN CALLED JOE ROY (NW GAS AREA SUPERVISOR) TO CONFER ABOUT WHAT WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED TO RETURN THE SCHOOL SERVICE TO OPERATION.  AT THIS POINT THE SUSPICION WAS A FAILED SERVICE REGULATOR AND THE DISCUSSION REFLECTED THAT.    A SECOND CALL FROM THE SHERIFF¿S DISPATCHER REPORTING GAS LEAKING FROM THE SERVICE RELIEF VALVE AT THE CASINO PROMPTED JACK AND JOE TO SUSPECT A LARGER PROBLEM AND TO GET JACK GOING IMMEDIATELY TO CASS LAKE.  THE GAS WAS REPORTED SHUT OFF AT THE CASINO WHICH TERMINATED THE LEAK THERE AS WELL.    AT THIS POINT, JOE RECEIVED A CALL FROM GARY LINDSTROM, THE CASS LAKE AREA GREAT LAKES GAS TRANSMISSION COMPANY FIELD TECHNICIAN, THAT A NEIGHBOR TO THE TBS LOCATION HAD REPORTED A HISSING SOUND AND THAT MR. LINDSTROM WAS ENROUTE (1/2 HOUR TRAVEL).  JOE GAVE MR. LINDSTROM JACK¿S CELL NUMBER SO THAT THE TWO FIELD TECHS COULD COMMUNICATE.    JACK RECEIVED A CALL AT 11:07 FROM MR. LINDSTROM, WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE CASS LAKE TBS SITE, REPORTING THAT THERE WAS INDEED GAS ESCAPING FROM OUR SYSTEM¿S TATTLE-TALE RELIEF VALVE AND THAT THE ESCAPING GAS HAD IGNITED.  JACK INSTRUCTED MR. LINDSTROM TO CALL THE CASS LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHICH MR. LINDSTROM DID.  AT THIS POINT, JACK WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE SITE AND ARRIVED BEFORE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY HAD TURNED OFF A THIRD SERVICE (AT MAUREEN MOOSE¿S RESIDENCE) DUE TO GAS LEAKAGE FROM THE REGULATOR RELIEF OPENING.    ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO ACCESSIBLE PRESSURE GAUGES PRESENT WHICH COULD BE USED TO VERIFY THE DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE PRESSURE, JACK DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE IN OUR PIPELINE, SO HE TURNED OFF A GREAT LAKES VALVE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.  AT THIS POINT JOE ROY CALLED MIKE GORHAM, OWNER OF THE SYSTEM TO ADVISE HIM OF THE EVENTS GOING ON AND THAT JOE WAS ENROUTE TO CASS LAKE.  JOE ALSO CALLED STEVE MCNIFF (ANOTHER NW GAS FIELD TECH) TO GET HIM MOVING TO CASS LAKE.  MIKE PROCEEDED TO ACT AS THE INCIDENT RESPONSE LEADER COORDINATING THE RESPONSE FROM THAT POINT.    WITH THE GAS TURNED OFF AT THE GREAT LAKES END AND THE PRESSURE IN THE PIPELINE FALLING, MIKE ASKED JACK TO ARRANGE FOR A FIREMAN IN TURNOUT GEAR TO APPROACH THE STILL-DISCHARGING RELIEF VALVE AND TURN IT OFF IF THAT OPERATION COULD BE SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED IN TURNOUT GEAR.  THE FIREMAN AGREED AND THE GAS WAS SHUT OFF, WHICH EXTINGUISHED ALMOST ALL OF THE FIRE, THE ONLY REMNANT BEING GAS ESCAPING FROM THE SECOND-STAGE REGULATOR PILOT ON THE WEST REGULATOR RUN, WHICH WAS THEN ISOLATED USING THE INSTALLED ISOLATION VALVES.  THIS ELIMINATION OF THE FIRE HAZARD ALLOWED FOR THE INSERTION OF A PRESSURE GAUGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE.  THE INITIAL READING OF THIS GAUGE WAS JUST UNDER 110 PSIG.    AT THIS POINT, MIKE DIRECTED JOE TO STOP FIRST AT THE REPORTED GAS-OFF SITES TO RESTORE SERVICE.  SERVICE WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED.    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS RELEASED FROM ALL OF THE RESPONSE SITES.  THE NW GAS RESPONSE NOW TURNED TO PRESE"

MOUNTAINEER GAS COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED BY THE BROOKE COUNTY 911 CENTER THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED AT 2485 ELDERSVILLE ROAD IN THE HOOVERSTON HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD OF FOLLANSBEE, WEST VIRGINIA.  MOUNTAINEER IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED PERSONNEL TO THE SCENE AT 7:19 A.M.    MOUNTAINEER'S FIRST EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 7:23 A.M.  WHEN HE ARRIVED, HE WAS GIVEN ACCESS TO THE SITE BY FIREFIGHTERS.  HE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN LOOKING FOR THE CURB VALVE TO TURN OFF NATURAL GAS SERVICE.  HE CALLED THE COMPANY'S WEIRTON SERVICE CENTER FOR CURB VALVE MEASUREMENTS.  THE EMPLOYEE LOCATED THE CURB VALVE SERVING 2485 ELDERSVILLE ROAD AND TURNED OFF GAS SERVICE TO THE HOME AT 7:33 A.M.     AS A PRECAUTION, THE EMPLOYEE BEGAN SUSPENDING SERVICE TO AREA HOMES WHERE DAMAGE WAS VISIBLE.    ADDITIONAL MOUNTAINEER PERSONNEL ARRIVED AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO ASSIST WITH THE SUSPENSION OF SERVICE TO SURROUNDING STRUCTURES THAT WERE DAMAGED IN THE INCIDENT.  ONCE SERVICE WAS SUSPENDED, EMPLOYEES BEGAN CHECKING FLOOR DRAINS AND SERVICE ENTRANCES IN THE DAMAGED STRUCTURES IN ORDER TO DETECT ANY MIGRATING GAS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PRESENT.  NO GAS WAS DETECTED.      ADDITIONALLY, MOUNTAINEER EMPLOYEES BEGAN LOCATING AND MARKING MAINS AND SERVICE LINES IN THE AREA.  EMPLOYEES PERFORMED A THOROUGH HFI SURVEY OVER THESE LINES.  ALL TESTS WERE NEGATIVE, AND NO GAS WAS DETECTED.    FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THESE TASKS, MOUNTAINEER PERSONNEL AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF PERSONNEL FROM THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL.      AFTER BEING ADVISED BY FIREFIGHTERS THAT GAS WAS STILL PRESENT AT THE METER SET LOCATED ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE RESIDENCE AT 2485 ELDERSVILLE ROAD, FOLLOWING THE ARRIVAL OF ASSISTANT FIRE MARSHAL MACKEY AYERSMAN, AND WITH HIS APPROVAL, EMPLOYEES DUG UP THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AT THE METER SET, CAREFULLY REMOVED THE METER SET, AND THEN TESTED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AT A PRESSURE OF 45 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.  THE LINE SHOWED NO LEAKAGE.  HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER'S FLEX RISER WAS FOUND TO BE DAMAGED, APPARENTLY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION.     MOUNTAINEER PERSONNEL ALSO TESTED FOR GAS AROUND THE ENTIRE PERIMETER OF 2485 ELDERSVILLE ROAD USING CGI EQUIPMENT.  DAVID HIPPCHEN, MANAGER OF PIPELINE SAFETY FOR THE WEST VIRGINIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WAS PRESENT FOR THIS TESTING, AND DOCUMENTED THOSE FINDINGS.  ODOROMETER TESTING WAS ALSO PERFORMED AT THE RESIDENCES OF SEVERAL NEARBY CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, AND ODORANT WAS READILY NOTICEABLE IN ALL INSTANCES BY CUSTOMERS AND MOUNTAINEER PERSONNEL ALIKE.    COMPANY PERSONNEL WITH THE APPROVAL OF ASSISTANT FIRE MARSHAL AYERSMAN ALSO TESTED SERVICE AND HOUSE LINES TO DAMAGED STRUCTURES SURROUNDING 2485 ELDERSVILLE ROAD, AND RESTORING GAS SERVICE TO STRUCTURES WHERE SERVICE WAS DETERMINED TO BE FREE OF PROBLEMS.      CUSTOMER HOUSE PIPING AT BOTH 2471 AND 2500 ELDERSVILLE ROAD WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING AND WERE LEFT TURNED OFF AT THE CURB.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED AT OTHER NEARBY RESIDENCES WHERE TESTING WAS PERFORMED.    NO LEAKS INVOLVING MOUNTAINEER'S DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES WERE DETECTED AT ANY POINT, AND THE INCIDENT THEREFORE APPEARS TO HAVE ORIGINATED INSIDE THE RESIDENCE AT 2485 ELDERSVILLE ROAD.    ASSISTANT FIRE MARSHAL AYERSMAN'S REPORT IS INCOMPLETE AT THIS TIME, BUT THERE WAS BEEN NO SUGGESTION THAT ANY OF MOUNTAINEER'S FACILITIES PLAYED A ROLE IN THE INCIDENT."

SMITH	MANAGER GAS OPERATIONS	304-464-5936	kenneth.l.smith@dom.com	"AT 06:09 ON 10/08/2013, AN OVERPRESSURE EVENT OCCURRED ON DOMINION HOPE GAS' MAIN PIPELINE (HM-3095).  THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE FAILURE OF HOPE GAS REGULATORS DUE TO ICING CONDITIONS.  THESE REGULATORS ARE LOCATED IN STATION HX-363 AND REDUCE PRESSURE FROM OVER 500 PSIG TO 70 PSIG.    AT 06:47, A SERVICE PIPELINE THAT IS CONNECTED TO M-3095 RUPTURED, CAUSING A BLOWING LEAK.  THE SYSTEM WAS ISOLATED AND COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AT 8:10.  NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OCCURRED.    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES, INC.) WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE INCIDENT AND RECOMMEND CHANGES.  AS ADVISED BY JANA LABS' PRELIMINARY REPORT, DOMINION HOPE GAS IS IN THE PROCESS OF INSPECTING AND/OR REPLACING VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM.  TESTING OF THE PIPELINES AND THE REGULATING/METERING STATIONS WILL BE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 46 CFR PART 192.  THE SYSTEM WILL BE PLACED INTO SERVICE ONLY WHEN ALL COMPONENTS ARE DEEMED SAFE AND OPERATIONAL.    AS REQUESTED BY DOMINION, JANA LABORATORIES IS COMPILING AN ADDITIONAL REPORT TO RECOMMEND LONG-RANGE PLANS AND CONCERNS.    COMPLETION INFORMATION:    A CONSULTANT (JANA LABORATORIES) COMPLETED AN EVALUATION OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE SYSTEM:    5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS  BASED ON THE ANALYSIS TO DATE AND THE TESTING OF THE SAMPLES RECEIVED, THE FOLLOWING  RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE:  &#61623; THE OVERPRESSURIZATION RESULTED IN THE EXPOSURE OF THREE REGULATOR STATIONS, THE HDPE  MAINLINE, AND THE MDPE BRANCH TO INCREASING PRESSURE UP TO >500 PSIG (MAXIMUM 528 PSIA,  OR 513 PSIG), RAMPING UP OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS  REPORTEDLY THE FAILURE OF REGULATOR STATION HX-363 TO REGULATE PRESSURE FROM THE TRANSMISSION  LINE DUE TO FROZEN WATER IN THE REGULATOR RUN.  &#61623; THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIPES AND FITTINGS HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:  O 6"" HDPE PIPE AND ASSOCIATED HEAT FUSION, ELECTROFUSION, AND TRANSITION FITTINGS: NO  EXPECTED IMPACT OF OVERPRESSURIZATION ON LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE  O 6"" HDPE BALL VALVES: NO EXPECTED IMPACT OF OVERPRESSURIZATION ON LONG-TERM  PERFORMANCE  O 4"" MDPE PIPE AND ASSOCIATED HEAT FUSION, ELECTROFUSION, AND TRANSITION FITTINGS  AFFECTED (PIPE BURST); NON-BURST REGIONS EXPOSED TO PRESSURE CLOSE TO TENSILE LIMIT  O 4"" MDPE BALL VALVE: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; EXPOSED TO PRESSURE CLOSE TO TENSILE LIMIT  &#61623; THE INTEGRITY OF THE REGULATOR STATIONS HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS FOLLOWS:  O HX-363: NOT EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED; ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF ENTRAINED WATER FREEZING  ADVISED BEFORE REPRESSURIZATION  O TYGART VALLEY REGIONAL JAIL: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; METER, VALVES, AND REGULATORS EXPOSED TO  PRESSURE > MAOP  O IS-267: POSSIBLY AFFECTED; METER, VALVES AND REGULATORS EXPOSED TO PRESSURE > MAOP  &#61623; ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED COMPONENTS SHOULD BE CLOSELY EXAMINED FOR DAMAGE (IN SIMILAR  FASHION TO HX-363 AFTER THE INCIDENT) AND REPLACED IF DAMAGE IS FOUND. IT HAS BEEN INDICATED  THAT THE JAIL REGULATOR STATION AND THE ENTIRE MDPE LINE ARE SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED..    1 . REGULATORS WERE COMPLETED DISASSEMBLED AND INSPECTED AT ALL THREE STATIONS BY A CONSULTANT (MASTER CONTROLS).       REGULATORS WERE FOUND TO BE UNAFFECTED BY THE OVERPRESSURE SITUATION.  2   TWIN 3X4 MERCER RELIEF VALVES WERE INSTALLED AS ADDITIONAL OVER-PRESSURE PROTECTION AT THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION.  3.  BRUEST PILOT HEATERS WERE INSTALLED ON THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION.  4.  NEW STEEL ENAMEL BUILDING INSTALLED OVER THE HIGH PRESSURE CUT REGULATION STATION TO PROTECT HEATERS FROM THE WIND.  5.  MDPE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACE WITH HDPE.  6.  ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS RETESTED WITH AIR TO 155 LBS.  7.  COMPLETE STATION INSPECTIONS WERE PERFORMED WHEN GAS WAS REINTRODUCED.     GAS WAS REINTRODUCED ON 11/25/13."

PRIOR TO COMMENCING THE DRILLING WORK, THE CONTRACTOR CALLED THE HAWAII ONE CALL CENTER TO REQUEST THAT TONING BE DONE BY HG TO MARK THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE GAS LINE.  PER THE CONTRACTOR'S ONE CALL REQUEST, HG RESPONDED AND MARKED THE LOCATION OF ITS FACILITY.  USING THE TONING MARKS BY HG AND ITS OWN EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM THE LOCATION OF THE GAS MAIN BEFORE DRILLING.  HG WAS ADVISED THAT THE CONTRACTOR ATTEMPTED TO AVOID DAMAGING OUR LINE BY DRILLING MORE THAN 30 INCHES HORIZONTALLY FROM THE PIPE LOCATION TONING MARK AND TEST BORING USING A NON-POWERED AUGER BEFORE USE OF THE POWERED DRILL RIG.    THE GAS MAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET DEEP WHEN THE CONTRACTOR'S POWERED DRILLING RIG HIT IT.  HG DISPATCHED A CREW TO BEGIN EXCAVATING TO INSTALL LINE STOP FITTINGS.  DUE TO THE PIPE'S DEPTH, HG HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING AND EXPOSING THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE LINE WHERE THE REPAIR WORK WOULD NEED TO BE DONE AND HALTED WORK AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF EXCAVATING.  TWO PERSONNEL REMAINED ON SITE OVERNIGHT TO MONITOR THE LEAK.    ON 9/24/13, A NEW LOCATION WITH IMPROVED ACCESS TO THE GAS MAIN WAS SELECTED.  AT 10:00 AM, THE FEDERAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN THE NEARBY NAVAL HOUSING AREA AS A PRECAUTION DUE TO THE DETECTION OF GAS.  HG LEAK INSPECTORS PERFORMED BELOW GRADE STRUCTURE CHECKS AND DETECTED 100% GAS READINGS IN SEVERAL MANHOLES.

AS PART OF THE INCIDENT RESPONSE, A GAS SERVICE WORKER CHECKED THE HOME ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE FAILURE POINT, AND PERFORMED ADDITIONAL BAR TESTS WITHIN THE SOIL NEAR THE FAILURE.  NONE OF THESE TESTS FOUND ANY GAS MIGRATION.  ALL THE GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE DIRECTLY ABOVE THE POINT OF FAILURE.    THE POINT OF FAILURE ON THE MAIN WAS UNDER A COUNTY DRAIN DITCH, APPROXIMATELY 20' BELOW THE ROAD GRADE AND UNDER 14' OF SOIL.  THE MAIN WAS CAPPED ON EACH SIDE OF THE FAILURE UPON SHUTOFF.    THE FAILURE POINT WAS LATER EXTRACTED AND ANALYZED, REVEALING A FAILED BUTT FUSE JOINT.  INADEQUATE FUSE BEAD ROLLOVER WAS OBSERVED ON ONE SIDE OF THE FUSE, INDICATING POSSIBLE INCOMPLETE FACING PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE HYDRAULIC BUTT FUSE MACHINE.  THE NON-FUSED ZONE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A GENERALLY SMOOTH FLAT SURFACE APPEARANCE, AS WELL AS PARALLEL CUT MARKS WHICH LIKELY INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE HAD NOT BEEN HEATED TO THE MELTING POINT DURING THE JOINT FUSION OPERATION.    INITIAL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT MORE THAN 3 MMCF OF GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED DURING THE LEAK, BUT REVISED FINDINGS (BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF THE FAILED FUSE; SEE ATTACHED), INDICATE A GAS RELEASE OF LESS THAN 1 MMCF.  A SUPPLEMENTAL PHMSA INCIDENT REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED HEREWITH TO REFLECT THIS, AND ALSO REFLECT THE COSTS INCURRED DURING REPLACEMENT AND INVESTIGATION OF THE FAILED MAIN."

THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT IS A COMMERCIAL/ INDUSTRIAL SITE.  APPROXIMATELY 45 PEOPLE HAD BEEN EVACUATED FROM BUILDINGS IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.  TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE INJURED BY THE FLASH FIRE.  ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS TREATED AND RELEASED.  THE SECOND INDIVIDUAL WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR TREATMENT OF SECOND DEGREE BURNS. WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL PERFORMED LEAK SURVEYS IN THE AREA OF THE IGNITION AND IN A WIDENING AREA ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE INVOLVEMENT OF NATURAL GAS FROM A FACILITY. BAR AND TEST HOLES WERE PUT DOWN OVER WASHINGTON GAS FACILITIES IN THE AREA AND ADDITIONAL LEAK CHECKS WERE PERFORMED IN AND AROUND BUILDINGS IN THE AREA.  WASHINGTON GAS PERSONNEL VALVED OFF A FOUR INCH GAS MAIN AT THE INTERSECTION OF FAIGLE RD AND OLD BALTIMORE PIKE.  THE MAIN WAS EXPOSED AND A PRESSURE TEST CONDUCTED 560 FEET FROM THE MAIN DEADEND.  THE PRESSURE TEST DID NOT HOLD PRESSURE. A FIBER OPTIC CAMERA INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED ON THE GAS MAIN.  AN INTRUSION WAS NOTED 76 FEET FROM THE DEADEND.

GERC IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED ALL AVAILABLE UNITS.  THE FIRST TWO RESPONDERS ARRIVED AT 1205 AND 1206 RESPECTIVELY.  A STRONG ODOR OF GAS WAS PRESENT IN THE AIR AND GAS VAPORS COULD BE SEEN COMING FROM THE SEWER CLEAN OUT LOCATED ALONG THE CURBLINE OF 177 SOUTH HIGHLAND AVENUE, THE SKY ISLAND LODGE.  THE O&R SERVICEMEN IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A LEAK INVESTIGATION.  HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF GAS WERE DETECTED IN THE OUTDOOR SEWER CLEAN-OUTS, CATCH BASIN AND SEWER MANHOLE.    THERE WERE NO GAS READINGS IN THE TEST POINTS TAKEN IN THE EARTH.  COVERS ON THE SEWER CLEAN OUTS AND MANHOLES WERE REMOVED ALLOWING THESE STRUCTURES TO VENT.  AT 1211, A 7% GAS-IN-AIR READING WAS RECORDED IN ATMOSHERE INSIDE THE DAMAGED BUILDING AT 177 SOUTH HIGHLAND. THE SERVICE TO THIS BUILDING WAS IMMEDIATELY TURNED OFF AND ISOLATED.  THE ELECTRIC CONTROL CENTER WAS CONTACTED TO DE-ENERGIZE THE AREA AT 1234.  258 WERE AFFECTED. GAS MAIN VALVES WERE IDENTIFIED AND CLOSED TO ISOLATE THE AREA AFFECTING 33 CUSTOMERS.  UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A MAINTENANCE WORKER CONTRACTED BY NYACK COLLEGE WAS PERFORMING SOME GRADING OF THE PROPERTY BEHIND 154 SOUTH HIGHLAND, THE BOWMAAN GYM THE MORNING OF THE EXPLOSION.  THIS WORKER, USING A BACKHOE, PULLED ON THE 2"" STEEL GAS SERVICE FOR THE BOWMAN GYM CAUSING IT TO PULL FROM A CONNECTING COUPLING CAUSING GAS TO LEAK.  THE GAS THEN MIGRATED THROUGH A STORM DRAIN INTO THE SEWER SYSTEM THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE SKY ISLAND LODGE.  AN UNCAPPED, OPEN SEWER TRAP WAS DISCOVERED IN THE BASEMENT OF THE SKY ISLAND LODGE.  THIS WAS DEEMED THE POINT OF ENTRY INTO THE BUILDING FOR THE GAS.  THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED SHORTLY THEREAFTER."

A WATER PUMP WAS BEING USED TO REMOVE EXCESS WATER WHILE THE CREW BEGAN REMOVING SCALE OFF THE STEEL MAIN LINE WITH A PNEUMATIC SCALER TO INSTALL A LEAK CLAMP WHEN THE NATURAL GAS PRESENT IN THE EXCAVATION IGNITED. ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS IN THE OPEN EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE IGNITION. THE FIRE WAS IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED BY THE SECOND CREW MEMBER. THE CREW MEMBER SUBJECTED TO THE IGNITION IMMEDIATELY EXITED THE EXCAVATION. HE THEN REMOVED HIS NOMEX HOOD AND OTHER FIRE RESISTANT CLOTHING AND SAFETY APPAREL. HE WAS GIVEN FIRST AID AND 911 WAS CALLED.      AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF INCIDENT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AND CAN NOT ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE WITH ANY REASONALBLE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.     COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO¿S THIRD PARTY CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THERE WERE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES OF IGNITION IN THE EXCAVATION AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; A PNEUMATIC SCALER AND AN ELECTRIC WATER PUMP.  THE DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRIC WATER PUMP¿S WIRING AND PROTECTIVE BOOT ALLOWED ARCING WHICH IS LIKELY THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THERE IS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS THE CONDITION OF THE PROTECTIVE BOOT WAS COMPROMISED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE COLUMBIA GAS OF OHIO INC. HAS PROHIBITED THE USE OF THESE WATER PUMPS BY ALL REPAIR CREWS AND IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A REPLACEMENT WATER PUMP WHICH IS NOT ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN.  IN ADDITION, WHILE THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT INDICATE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SCALER, COLUMBIA IS ALSO ISSUING A SAFETY BULLETIN TO OUR MAINTENANCE CREWS ADVISING THEM TO ENSURE A COBALT PISTONS ARE BEING UTILIZED.     PLEASE CONSIDER THIS COLUMBIA'S FINAL REPORT ON THIS INCIDENT."

GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (GDS), GAS CONSTRUCTION AND SUPERVISION WERE NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED. GAS CONSTRUCTION CONDUCTED A LEAK INVESTIGATION SURVEY OVER THE ROUTE OF THE 1948 12"" STEEL TRANSMISSION MAIN (245 PSI SYSTEM) AND THE 16"" MEDIUM PRESSURE CAST IRON (MPCI) MAIN IN THE AREA. ALL SUBSURFACE STRUCTURES IN THE AREA WERE CHECKED AND FOUND CLEAR; THERE WERE NO BUILDINGS IN THE AREA. GAS CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED AND CONTINGENCY CASE 39-A WAS INITIATED. ISOLATION VALVES 25977 AND 25976 WERE STAFFED AND GAS CONTROL CONFIRMED COMMUNICATION WITH REMOTE OPERATED VALVE (ROV) 32717. GAS CREWS CONTINUED TO AERATE, PINPOINT AND MONITOR THE AREA. ON THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2013 AT 08:41 THE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED A PROBABLE TRANSMISSION MAIN LEAK APPROXIMATELY 175' SOUTH OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL GAS PIPELINE (TGPL) WHITE PLAINS GATE STATION LOCATED AT BRONX STREET AND MOTT STREET (WP).TRANSMISSION ENGINEERING, DISTRIBUTION ENGINEERING, GAS CONTROL, MAJOR PROJECTS, TECHNICAL OPERATIONS, GERC AND WESTCHESTER GAS OPERATIONS PARTICIPATED IN OPERATIONAL PLANNING TO IDENTIFY THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO REPAIR THE SUSPECTED 12"" COUPLING BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. REPAIR PROCEDURE MPC-13-09 WAS INITIATED AND ON FRIDAY, MARCH 22, 2013 AT 10:16 THE SEGMENT OF TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURE REDUCED FROM 214 PSI TO 62 PSI. REPAIR OPERATIONS CONTINUED AROUND-THE-CLOCK AND A VISIBLE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED ON A 12"" COMPRESSION COUPLING. A WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED TO SECURE THE LEAK. A SECOND WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON A COUPLING NOT LEAKING BUT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AS A PRECAUTION. ON SATURDAY, MARCH 23, 2013 A PRELIMINARY MOBILE LEAK SURVEY WAS PERFORMED IN ADVANCE OF PRESSURE RESTORATION AND (2) LEAKS WERE FOUND ALONG THE ROUTE OF THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. THE LEAKS WERE INVESTIGATED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS NOT THE SOURCE OF THE READINGS DETECTED. A THIRD T-1 WAS DETECTED DURING PRESSURE RESTORATION AND A 16"" MPCI HUB WAS FOUND TO BE THE SOURCE OF THAT LEAK.  ON MONDAY, MARCH 25, 2013 AT 02:00 THE ISOLATED SEGMENT WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE. GAS CONTROL AND PRESSURE CONTROL ARE RETURNING THE REGULATOR STATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS PROCEDURE TO NORMAL SETTINGS. THERE WERE NO OUTAGES AS A RESULT OF THIS OPERATIONAL PLAN. NO EVACUATIONS, INJURIES OR MEDIA ATTENTION WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT. THE WHITE PLAINS FIRE DEPARTMENT (WPFD) WAS NOTIFIED AND THE WPFD RESPONDED PER THE TRANSMISSION LEAK NOTIFICATION PROTOCOL AND REPAIR OPERATIONS WERE REVIEWED. THE US DOT AND NYS PSC WERE NOTIFIED AND THE PSC RESPONDED TO LOCATION. THIS WAS A SERIOUS LEVEL INCIDENT."

WORKING WITH LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS, CONSUMERS ENERGY EXCAVATED AND SHUT OFF THE GAS SUPPLY TO 4232 COOPER AVE AT 1836 HOURS.    INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE INCIDENT REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE CREWS DID NOT FOLLOW COMPANY BORING PROCEDURES DURING INSTALLATION OF A NEW MAIN ALONG COOPER AVENUE.  AS A RESULT, THE OPERATION CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE STEEL GAS SERVICE LOCATED AT 4232 COOPER AVENUE IN ROYAL OAK, MICHIGAN, RESULTING IN POSSIBLE BELOW-GRADE GAS MIGRATION INTO THE STRUCTURE.  INVESTIGATION ESTABLISHED THAT CREWS DID NOT FOLLOW CONSUMERS ENERGY PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS TO EXCAVATE AND EXPOSE ALL ACTIVE SERVICES PRIOR TO PERFORMING BORING OPERATIONS.

NOTE (5/15/2013 SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT):  DESPITE THE NEARBY FACILITIES BEING STAKED CORRECTLY (PART G3-12) AND LOCATE MARKS BEING VISIBLE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE BORING AREA (PART G3-11), FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT THERE WAS MINIMAL OBSERVATION OF STAKING FLAGS OR PAINT MARKING AT SOME SERVICE LOCATIONS ALONG COOPER AVENUE.  THAT MARKING WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT DURING POST-INCIDENT OBSERVATIONS MAY BE DUE IN PART TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF DEBRIS IN THE AREA (AS WELL AS RECENT SNOWFALL) PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTING DIRECT OBSERVATION OF ALL FACILITY STAKING ALONG COOPER AVENUE."

HEARTLAND MIDWEST, LLC FAILED TO PROPERLY VERIFY THE LOCATION OF THE GAS MAIN BY TEST-HOLE (POT-HOLING).  THE INCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, SO THERE MAY BE OTHER FAILURES IDENTIFIED.  MGE IS STILL INVESTIGATING TO DETERMINE WHAT TIME THE GAS MAIN WAS ACTUALLY STRUCK BY THE DIRECTIONAL DRILLING EQUIPMENT. IN REFERENCE TO PART A, QUESTION 16, MGE GAVE EVACUATION ORDERS TO TWO STRUCTURES (906 AND 910 W 48TH STREET).    THE EXPLOSION AT JJ'S RESTAURANT, 910 W. 48TH STREET, KANSAS CITY, MO, OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 18:04.  THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE (ON 48TH STREET) WAS CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 19:20.  THEN, THE TWO-INCH PE GAS MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT THE SE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW (ON BELLEVIEW) AT APPROXIMATELY 20:00.  AFTER THE GAS FLOW WAS ELIMINATED, THE WEST END OF THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET WAS CUT AND CAPPED ON THE NE CORNER OF 48TH AND BELLEVIEW, AND THE EAST END OF THE GAS MAIN WAS CUT AND CAPPED JUST WEST OF THE TWO-INCH VALVE AT THE NW CORNER OF 48TH AND ROANOKE.  THEN, THE GAS MAIN ON BELLEVIEW WAS RE-ENERGIZED TO ALLOW GAS FLOW TO CUSTOMERS ON BELLEVIEW BETWEEN 48TH AND 47TH STREETS.  THE GAS MAIN ON 48TH STREET BETWEEN BELLEVIEW AND ROANOKE IS STILL INACTIVE, INCLUDING THE SERVICE LINES TO 906 AND 910 W. 48TH STREET.    THERE WAS ONE FATALITY AND MULTIPLE INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION.  MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  MGE ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT EMPLOYEES OF HEARTLAND MIDWEST AND JJ'S RESTAURANT WERE INJURED, BUT THE EXACT NUMBER OF INJURIES IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.  THERE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT THE TOTAL ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.    MGE HAD SIX EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  SINCE MGE WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE A FULL INVESTIGATION ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF ITS ON-SITE EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, FIVE OF THE SIX EMPLOYEES WERE SENT TO THE HOSPITAL LATER THAT EVENING OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION FOR DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING.  THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER DOT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING FOR ALL FIVE EMPLOYEES.  BOTH DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO FOUR OF THE EMPLOYEES, WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS.  A DRUG TEST WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE WITH NO POSITIVE RESULTS.  THE HOSPITAL WAS INSTRUCTED TO ADMINISTER AN ALCOHOL TEST TO THE FIFTH EMPLOYEE, BUT DID NOT.  THE SIXTH EMPLOYEE, MGE'S FIRST RESPONDER WHO WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS IN THE ICU AFTER THE INCIDENT AND IT IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME WHETHER HE UNDERWENT POST-ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AS PART OF HIS MEDICAL TREATMENT.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, MGE DOES NOT BELIEVE ITS EMPLOYEES' PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT, AND THEREFORE BELIEVES THAT NONE OF THESE TESTS WERE NECESSARY."

HFD DISPATCHER ADVISED THAT THEY RECEIVED A REPORT OF A ""BOOM"" FOLLOWED BY FIRE.  GAS WAS SMELLED IN THE AREA AND OUR CREWS WERE URGENTLY REQUESTED.    OPERATOR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM HU GAS DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE AT 2230 (10:30PM CST) ON JANUARY 15, 2013.  HFD AND THE HUNTSVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT (HPD) WERE ON SITE AND HAD EXTINGUISHED A FIRE AT THE PUBLIC HOUSING DWELLING UNIT AT 851 UNIT C WASHINGTON ST AND SECURED THE AREA.  UPON SMELLING NATURAL GAS THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS CALLED FOR ADDITIONAL HELP TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE APPARENT GAS LEAK.    CREWS WERE CALLED IN AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SHUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO THE ENTIRE PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT AT 0230 (2:30AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN UNDERGROUND STEEL DISTRIBUTION VALVE, 2 INCH IN DIAMETER, HAD A CRACKED FLANGE.  THIS LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REMOVING THE VALVE ALONG WITH ANOTHER SIMILIAR VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH COATED STEEL PIPE.  THE LEAK WAS TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM THE DWELLING AT 851 WASHINGTON ST.  GAS SERVICE WAS THEN RESTORED TO THE AREA AT 0745 (7:45AM CST) ON JANUARY 16, 2013.      AFTER THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED HU GAS DEPARTMENT CREWS BEGAN TO CONDUCT A NUMBER OF TESTS IN THE VICINTY OF 851 WASHINGTON ST.  THESE TESTS INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY, CATHODIC PROTECTION PIPE TO SOIL READINGS, BAR HOLE TEST AND A PRESSURE TEST OF ALL THREE GAS SERVICE LINES TO 851 WASHINGTON ST., AS THIS BUILDING WAS A TRI-PLEX COMPRISED OF UNITS A, B, AND C.  ALL THREE GAS SERVICES HELD THE TEST PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATLY +125 PSIG WITH NO LEAKS INDICATED.  A TEST OF THE FUEL LINE (CUSTOMER PIPING) AT UNIT C FAILED, INDICATING A LEAK INSIDE THE UNIT.    AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS ON GOING.  CONTRIBUTING FACTOR(S) MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEAK ON THE FUEL LINE, THE UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK OR SOME OTHER FACTOR.    THE LOCAL WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE A TEMPERATURE OF 37 DEGREES FARENHEIT,  THE WIND SPEED WAS 5 MPH, NO WIND GUSTS, WIND DIRECTION WAS 300 (GENERALLY OUT OF THE NORTHWEST).  IT WAS OVERCAST WITH A LIGHT RAINFALL.    A SUPPLEMENTAL OR SUPPLEMENTAL PLUS FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED AS SOON AS NEW, UPDATED AND/OR CORRECTED INFORMATION IS KNOWN."

THE MAINLINE, OWNED AND OPERATED BY AVISTA UTILITIES, WAS OPERATING AT 289 PSIG (300 PSIG - SYSTEM MAOP) AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE EXCAVATOR DIG-IN RESULTED IN BLOWING GAS THAT IGNITED IN EXPLOSION, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN EXCAVATOR BACKFIRE. THE RESULTING FIRE TOTALED THE EXCAVATOR EQUIPMENT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT AND CAUSED ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO A RAILROAD CROSS-ARM, AN ADJACENT WAREHOUSE STRUCTURE AND LOCAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES (ALSO OWNED AND OPERATED BY AVISTA UTILITIES). IT IS AVISTA'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS OPERATING USING LOCATES FROM A ONE-CALL TICKET THAT HAD EXPIRED 14-DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT AND MARKS WERE NO LONGER FULLY VISIBLE.     AVISTA DISPATCH WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1335-HOURS. AVISTA PERSONNEL WERE EN-ROUTE BY 1338-HOURS AND ON LOCATION BY 1351-HOURS. GAS FLOW WAS ISOLATED AT 1355-HOURS BY CLOSING THREE SYSTEM EOP VALVES (AVISTA VALVE #S LEC 128, LEC 130 & LEC 542) WITHIN CLOSE VICINITY TO THE AREA. AT THIS TIME LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDERS WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FIRE. POLICE ALSO RESPONDED AND LOCAL MEDIA FOLLOWED THE INCIDENT CLOSELY.  THERE WERE NO DEATHS AND ONLY MINOR INJURIES (NO HOSPITALIZATION REQUIRED) AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT.     AVISTA GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS WORKED TO REPAIR DAMAGED GAS FACILITIES OVER THE NEXT 9-DAYS FOLLOWING THE DIG-IN. THE SYSTEM WAS REPAIRED, RE-TESTED AND RESTORED TO FULL OPERATION BY 1530-HOURS ON 11/28/2012. ONLY ONE AVISTA NATURAL GAS CUSTOMER LOST SERVICE AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS.    THE RESULTING OPERATOR AND NON-OPERATOR DAMAGE COSTS FROM THE EVENT ARE ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $50,000 WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THIS REPORTABLE. THE DETAILS RELATED TO THESE COSTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BASED UPON THE BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION AT THIS TIME. WE PLAN TO REPORT SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION IF NECESSARY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE."

THIS RESIDENCE IS A GARAGE APARTMENT BEHIND 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH, FL. THE SERVICE TECH FROM FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILTIES ARRIVED AT 11:59 AM AND FOUND THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO 410 59TH ST. TURNED OFF AT THE METER BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AS THEY WERE EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE.  THE TECH FOUND THE 3/4"" BARE STEEL NATURAL GAS SERVICE LEAKING UNDER A CONCRETE SLAB AT THE RESIDENCE. FLORIDA PUBLIC UTLITIES DISPATCHED A DISTRIBUTION CREW TO CUT THE SERVICE AT THE MAIN AND CAP IT AT 1:00 PM ON 8/28/12.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AS A RESULT OF TROPICAL STORM ISAAC, THERE WERE MULTIPLE LIGHTENING STRIKES IN THE AREA OF THE RESIDENCE ON FRIDAY, 8/24/12. NEWS REPORTS STATED THAT THE RESIDENT OF 410.5 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH STARTED SMELLING GAS AROUND THIS TIME. HE DID NOT NOTIFY FLORIDA PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT LOOKED FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR HIMSELF ON TUESDAY, 8/28/12.  ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT IS A PICTURE OF A SECTION OF 3/4"" BARE STEEL SERVICE THAT WAS CUT AND CAPPED AT 410 59TH ST., WEST PALM BEACH. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A HOLE CAUSED BY AN ELECTRICAL ARC.    FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS DETERMINIED THAT THE 3/4"" BS GAS SERVICE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CAST IRON SEWER LINE AND A GALVANIZED ELECTRICAL CONDUIT. THE ELECTRICAL CONDUIT WAS INSTALLED AT SOME POINT AFTER THE GAS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE GARAGE WAS CONVERTED INTO AN APARTMENT AND A CONCRETE SLAB WAS POURED OVER THEM ON THE GROUND.    STRAY CURRENT EITHER FROM AN ELECTIC POWER POLE OR INDUCED UPON THE  CONDUIT AND PIPING CAUSED AN ARC BETWEEN THE CONDUIT AND PIPES RESULTING IN A SMALL HOLE IN THE GAS PIPING. GAS LEAKED UNDER THE SLAB AS A RESULT OF THE ARC HOLE BEGINNING ON 8/24/12 AND VENTED INTO THE GARAGE APARTMENT. WHEN THE RESIDENT OF 410 59TH ST. BEGAN TO LOOK FOR THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR ON 8/28/12, HE LIT A CIGARETTE, IGNITING THE GAS IN THE APARTMENT.    THIS INCIDENT IS STILL PART OF AN ACTIVE LITIGATION AS OF 4/28/2014."

THE FIRST MATERIAL THAT IGNITED WAS NATURAL GAS VAPORS THAT HAD LEECHED INTO THE RESIDENCE AFTER A GAS SERVICE LINE HAD BEEN CRACKED OR BROKEN.  THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THE RISER AND A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE.  WHILE THE EXACT IGNITION FACTOR IS NOT KNOWN, ANY APPLIANCE THAT WOULD CYCLE ON OR OFF WOULD LIKELY HAVE PROVIDED SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO IGNITE THE NATURAL GAS/AIR MIXTURE ONCE IT HAD REACHED THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.    WITH RESPECT TO THE BROKEN OR CRACKED GAS SERVICE LINE THAT RESULTED IN THE GAS LEAK, WE KNOW THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE PRECEDING 4 YEARS, THE RESIDENT HAD FILLED A SINK-TYPE OF HOLE IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE HOME THAT WAS ABOVE THE GAS LINE AND NEAR THE METER.  THE SETTLING OF THE SOIL IN THAT HOLE COULD HAVE PUT STRESS ON THE GAS LINE.  IN ADDITION, IN THE DAY (OR DAYS) BEFORE THE FIRE, A MEMBER OF THE RESIDENT'S FAMILY HAD ADDED CLASS FIVE ROCK TO THE TOP OF THE SINK HOLE AREA AND THEN PACKED IT DOWN WITH A BOBCAT, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDED TO OR CREATED STRESS ON THE GAS LINE, POSSIBLY ENOUGH TO CRACK OR BREAK IT AT THAT TIME.  XCEL ENERGY DOES NOT HAVE RECORDS OF THIS CUSTOMER CONTACTING US FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE SINK HOLE NEAR THE GAS LINE, OR MAKING US AWARE OF ANY RELATED PROBLEMS.  OUR RECORDS REVEAL THAT THE METER LOCATION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL LOCATION OF THE METER.   WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE METER WAS MOVED BY AN UNKNOWN PARTY, NOT XCEL ENERGY, TO MAKE ROOM FOR A GARAGE ADDITION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE APPROXIMATELY 2007.    THE SERVICE LINE TO THIS LOCATION WILL BE RUN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CUSTOMER AFTER HOME IS REBUILT."

THE WORK INCLUDED RETIRING AND IN SOME CASES REMOVING THE EXISTING LOW PRESSURE FACILITIES.  R&W BEGAN WORK ON THE PROJECT IN SEPTEMBER 2011.  ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT R&W WAS RETIRING A SECTION OF 12 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL GAS MAIN ON BROADWAY AT 1ST STREET IN WEST NYACK.  THE 12 INCH MAIN RUNS NORTH AND SOUTH ON BROADWAY AND HAD A RADIAL 4 INCH LOW PRESSURE STEEL MAIN COMING OFF TO THE WEST ON 1ST ST.  R&W EXCAVATED AND EXPOSED THE 12 INCH AND 4 INCH MAIN.   THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE INFLATED TO 4 PSI TESTED FOR LEAKAGE AND HELD PRESSURE FOR OVER ONE HOUR BEFORE BEING USED.  THEY INSTALLED TWO TAPPING TEES AND FOUR LOW PRESSURE BALLOON STOPPERS INTO THE 12 INCH PIPE AT THE LOCATIONS SHOWN ON THE SKETCH.  THE 4 INCH MAIN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEAD ENDED WITH A CAP FURTHER WEST ALONG 1ST STREET AND DID NOT REQUIRE ANY STOPPERS.  R&W THEN PERFORMED A FLOW TEST TO CONFIRM THAT GAS WAS BEING SUPPLIED TO THE MAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE ISOLATED SECTION.  THE PRESSURE GAUGES ON THE BALLOON STOPPERS WERE CHECKED TO CONFIRM THAT THE STOPPERS WERE HOLDING AND THAT THE SECTION WAS EFFECTIVELY ISOLATED.  R&W CUT THE 12 INCH PIPE ON THE NORTH END OF THE EXCAVATION WITH A REED 4 WHEEL PIPE CUTTER.  THEY THEN MADE TWO CUTS WITH A DEMO SAW ON THE 4 INCH STEEL MAIN, REMOVING A 4 INCH RING.    R&W USED AN ORBITAL CUTTER AND TORCH TO BEVEL CUT THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.   THE CREW MADE A SECOND CUT AND REMOVED ABOUT A 4 INCH RING AT THE SOUTHERLY END OF THE 12 INCH PIPE.  WHEN THE RINGS WERE CUT R&W HAD SUFFICIENT CLEARANCE AND THE CUT OUT SECTION WAS REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATION.  R&W SET UP THE ORBITAL CUTTER TO BEVEL THE ROUGH CUT ON THE NORTH END OF THE 12 INCH MAIN.  THE CONTRACTOR¿S WELDER AND CREW FOREMAN WERE IN THE EXCAVATION AND BEGAN TO MAKE THE BEVEL CUT.  AT 16:28, WHEN THEY HAD FLAME CUT APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE, THE NORTHERLY BALLOON STOPPERS FAILED AND THE LEAKING GAS IGNITED.  BOTH MEN EXITED THE EXCAVATION AND WERE NOT INJURED BY THE IGNITION OR THE ENSUING GAS FED FIRE.  THE THREE REGULATOR STATIONS SUPPLYING THE AFFECTED AREA WERE TURNED OFF AND THE RESIDUAL GAS BURNED OFF.  APPROXIMATELY 385 GAS SERVICES WERE INTERRUPTED.  OVERHEAD ELECTRIC FACILITIES IN THE AREA WERE DE-ENERGIZED INTERRUPTING APPROXIMATELY 650 SERVICES.  ELECTRIC SERVICE WAS RESTORED AT APPROXIMATELY 20:40 THAT EVENING.  GAS CONSTRUCTION INSTALLED COMPRESSION CAPS ON THE 12 INCH OPEN ENDS AND A WOODEN PLUG IN THE DEAD 4 INCH MAIN.  O&R SERVICE MECHANICS ALONG WITH CECONY GDS CREWS WORKED AROUND-THE-CLOCK TO RESTORE GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS.  GAS SERVICE WAS FULLY RESTORED AT 18:00 ON 6/24/12"

MICHAEL CLARK OF THE RESIDENCE HAD JUST ENTERED HIS GARAGE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SPECULATED THAT HE WAS ENTERING THE GARAGE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE.  TWO OTHER RESIDENTS WERE HOME AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE, DAKNEEKA PALMER, THE FIANCE OF MICHAEL CLARK, AND THEIR 9-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER, LEGACEE.  BOTH ESCAPED THE HOUSE UNHARMED.  THE ENERGY COOP WAS CONTACTED BY THE LICKING COUNTY 911 DISPATCHER AT 01:34 (5/14/12 - 1 HOUR 41 MINUTES AFTER THE EXPLOSION) TO RESPOND TO THE SITE TO ENSURE GAS WAS OFF TO THE STRUCTURE.  TWO ENERGY COOP EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHES, A LEAKAGE INSPECTOR MICHAEL CARR AND A SERVICE TECH TOM COOPER.  TOM ARRIVED 02:05 AND MIKE ARRIVED AT 02:20.  THEY VERIFIED GAS WAS OFF AND BEGAN A LEAKAGE INVESTIGATION.  AT 3:05, A LEAK WAS FOUND UNDER THE 20' WIDE APPROACH APRON OF THE DRIVEWAY AT 36 S. UTAH.  THE LEAKAGE EXTENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND THE DECISION TO SHUT THE MAIN DOWN ALONG WITH 8 CUSTOMERS WAS MADE.  THE VALVE TO SHUT THE LINE DOWN WAS TURNED AT 05:26 HOURS.  THE 2"" MAIN LINE SERVICING THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND CUT ON THE NORTH END AND SOUTH END OUTSIDE OF THE LEAKAGE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 250' OF 2"" PLASTIC MAIN LINE WAS INSTALLED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF UTAH AVENUE.  THE NEW LINE WAS TIE BACK INTO THE EXISTING LINE IN A MANNER THAT ISOLATED THE GAS MAIN IN THE LEAKAGE AREA.  THE OLD LINE WAS CAPPED TO PRESERVE THE LINE FOR FURTHER TESTING.  GAS SERVICE WAS REESTABLISHED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  ODORANT READINGS WERE TAKEN AND FOUND TO BE WELL WITHIN REQUIRED LIMITS.  THE REMAINDER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SURVEYED FOR LEAKAGE TO ENSURE THE AREA WAS SAFE AS IT RELATED TO GAS SERVICE.  AT 09:00 ON MAY 16TH , 2012 WE RETURNED TO THE SITE TO PERFORM AN INVESTIGATION.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE ISOLATED MAIN LINE AT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE (43#) TO TEST FOR LEAKAGE.  WE FOUND LEAKAGE ON THE ISOLATED 191' OF 2"" BARE STEEL.  WE ISOLATED APPROXIMATELY 90' NORTH OF THE 36 S. UTAH DRIVEWAY AND PRESSURE TESTED IT.  WE FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE TESTED THE SOUTHERN SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 100') AND FOUND LEAKAGE.  WE EXCAVATED TO EXPOSE THE MAIN LINE JUST SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY TO 36 S. UTAH AND CUT THE MAIN TO ISOLATE APROXIMATELY 45' THAT WAS UNDER THE DRIVE WAY.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE 65'SECTION SOUTH OF THE DRIVEWAY AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  WE PRESSURE TESTED THE SERVICE LINE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STRUCTURE AND FOUND NO LEAKAGE.  THIS ISOLATED THE LEAKAGE TO THE 45' SECTION LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVEWAY.  WE CUT THE CONCRETE AND PUT PRESSURE ON THE PIPING AND DETERMINED THERE WERE 2 LEAKAGE AREAS APPROXIMATELY 12' APPART UNDER THE EXISTING 20' CONCRETE DRIVEWAY."

THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE IGNITION SOURCE OR THE AREA WHERE GAS MAY HAVE BEEN RELEASED HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AS OF YET. ON 3/14/12 THERE WILL BE A COMBINED INVESTIGATION WITH SEVERAL PARTIES OF INTEREST TO TRY AND LOCATE THE ORIGIN OF THE LEAK AND OR THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS.      10/11/12- OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE COCK VALVE ON THE INSIDE OF THE DWELLING HAD A LEAK IN THE PACKING AND THE GAS ESCAPED THE COCK VALVE AND MIGRATED TOWARDS THE FURNACE AREA OF THE DWELLING. DUE TO THE HOUSE BEING VACANT AND VENELATION WAS MINIMAL THERE ENDED UP BEING A BUILD UP IN THE FURNACE AREA AND WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED IT IGNITED THE GAS AND THE RESULT OF THIS IGNITION WAS THE LOSS OF THIS DWELLING. THE GAS SERVICE TO THE DWELLING WAS ABANDONED AT THE MAIN ON THE DAY OF THE LOSS AND THE DWELLING SINCE HAS BEEN TORN DOWN DUE TO THE LOSS.    10/22/12- THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE INSIDE METER, THE OPERATOR OWNED COCK VALVE LEAKED IN THE PACKING AND RELEASED NATURAL GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE NATURAL GAS THAT WAS RELEASED, WHICH WAS THE FUEL SOURCE,IGNITED WHEN THE FURNACE CYCLED AND THE RESULT WAS THE LOSS THAT WAS BEEN REPORTED.  OUR INVESTIGATION IS CLOSED IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER AND THIS ENTRY SHALL SERVE AS OUR FINAL ENTRY IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER.     11/10/14- MUD HAS CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AND, AS A RESULT, NOW DRAWS A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN PREVIOUSLY ENTERED ON THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF THIS CONTINUED INVESTIGATION, MUD BELIEVES THAT THE PRIMARY GAS SOURCE THAT CAUSED THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE WAS THE INLET SWIVEL AND NOT THE GAS COCK VALVE. THIS CONCLUSION IS BASED UPON THE CONDITION OF THE METER, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FIRE WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MUD PERSONAL ARRIVED ON SCENE AND MUD EMPLOYEE'S EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GAS AND GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY WAY THE INLET SWIVEL COULD HAVE HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS FOR THE INLET SWIVEL TO HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY LOOSENED FROM THE GAS METER. MUD BELIEVES THAT THE GAS COCK VALVE MOST LIKELY BECAME LOOSENED AS A RESULT OF THE EXTREME HEAT FROM THE INITIAL EXPLOSION AND RESULTING FIRE BUT THAT THE GAS COCK VALVE DID NOT CAUSE THE EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE. MUD'S INVESTIGATION IS NOW CLOSED WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATTER AND IS THE SUBJECT OF ONGOING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE PROVIDER AND MUD."

WITNESSES REPORTED THE VEHICLE TRAVELLING NORTH AT 60-80 MPH MOMENTS BEFORE IMPACT AND, HAVING DISREGARDED A TRAFFIC SIGNAL APPROX ONE-HALF BLOCK TO THE SOUTH, JUMPED THE CURB AND LEFT THE ROADWAY PRIOR TO STRIKING THE LAHSER RESIDENCE, BREACHING THE OUTSIDE WALL, AND COMING TO REST INSIDE A BEDROOM.  FIRE IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE ENGULFED THE RESIDENCE AND THE VEHICLE.  EIGHT PERSONS IN THE RESIDENCE SELF-EVACUATED WITHOUT INJURY.  WITNESSES WERE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE THE VEHICLE DRIVER, WHO DIED AT THE SCENE FROM ACCIDENTAL INJURIES, FROM THE FIRE, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE.  A PASSENGER IN THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL AND UNDERWENT SURGERY FOR INJURIES.  A THIRD OCCUPANT OF THE VEHICLE REPORTEDLY FLED THE SCENE ON FOOT.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2011, AT 728 N. MINNESOTA, WICHITA, KANSAS.  THE HOUSE AT THE LOCATION WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED.  PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE AND ITS CONTENTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE $60,000.  TWO ADULTS, WILBER REED, JR. AND MIKAYLA FRIERSON, AND A TWO- YEAR OLD CHILD, KYMANI REED, WERE INJURED IN THE FIRE AND TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL FOR SMOKE INHALATION AND BURNS.  THE HOUSE STRUCTURE PROVIDED SOME EVIDENCE THAT AN EXPLOSION MAY HAVE OCCURRED, WITH ONE WALL COLLAPSING INTO A PILE OF DEBRIS.       UTILITY SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL GAS, WERE NOT PROVIDED TO THE PROPERTY.  NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS TERMINATED SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THE INCIDENT, AND THE METER WAS REMOVED IN JULY 2010.  THE OCCUPANTS OF THE HOUSE OBTAINED ELECTRICITY FROM MR. REED'S FATHER, WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR, THROUGH THE USE OF AN EXTENSION CORD.  TWO ELECTRIC SPACE HEATERS WERE FOUND IN THE HOUSE AND HAD APPARENTLY BEEN OPERATING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE.  A PROPANE TANK WAS ALSO DISCOVERED.    IN THE COURSE OF CONDUCTING A FIELD INVESTIGATION, THE SERVICE LINE TO THE HOUSE WAS INSPECTED, AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND.  A CRACK IN THE MAIN WAS DISCOVERED AT A DISTANCE OF 89 FEET FROM THE HOUSE.  THE MAIN WAS A 4-INCH CAST IRON PIPE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 1952.  NO LEAKS ON THE MAIN WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  A SERVICE LINE LEAK OFF THE MAIN WAS REPORTED IN 2006, AND THE SERVICE LINE WAS REPLACED WITH POLYETHYLENE PIPE.  A MOBILE LEAK SURVEY OF THE MAIN WAS COMPLETED ON MARCH 1, 2011; THE SERVICE LINES ON THE STREET WERE LEAK SURVEYED BY WALKING ON MARCH 25, 2011.  NO LEAKS WERE FOUND FROM EITHER SURVEY.    NATURAL GAS SAMPLES WERE TAKEN IN THE VICINITY OF THE HOUSE AND WERE TESTED ON DECEMBER 20, 2011, BY KANSAS GAS SERVICE.  THE TESTS SHOWED A POSSIBLE LACK OF CORRELATION WITH PIPELINE-QUALITY GAS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.    THE FOLLOWING DAY, DECEMBER 21, 2011, SEVERAL VAPOR SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE SOIL AND THE FOUNDATION OF THE PROPERTY.  THESE SAMPLES WERE SENT FOR ANALYSIS.  BAR HOLE TESTING WAS ALSO DIRECTED BY THE KANSAS CORPORATION COMMISSION.  IN ADDITION, GEO-PROBE TESTING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 20, 2012, ON THE PROPERTY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE FUEL SOURCE AND A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE INCIDENT.      THIS MATTER IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THE FIRE COULD HAVE BEEN STARTED BY THE SPACE HEATERS, BUT THE FUEL SOURCE IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.  THIS REPORT WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED WHEN TESTING AND FURTHER INVESTIGATION ARE COMPLETED.    ========================================================================   SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTS, JANUARY 18TH, 2013:  AFTER ADDITIONAL THIRD PARTY INVESTIGATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE GAS LEAK (CRACKED CI MAIN) OPERATING AT 9 OZ PRESSURE THAT WAS FOUND APPROXIMATELY 98' SW OF THE STRUCTURE, COULD NOT HAVE MIGRATED THROUGH THE EXISTING SOIL CONDITIONS TO THE STRUCTURE WHERE NATURAL GAS COULD HAVE ACCUMULATED TO A FLAMMABLE AMOUNT.  THEREFORE, AT THIS TIME THE COMPANY HAS MADE A CONCLUSION THAT NATURAL GAS FROM ITS PIPELINE WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE AT THIS STRUCTURE, HOWEVER THE COMPANY HAS NOT CLOSED ITS INVESTIGATION AND WILL FURTHER SUPPLEMENT THIS REPORT AS REQUIRED."

FRANCIS	DIRECTOR ENGINEERING AND ASSET MANAGEMENT	812-491-4369	jmfrancis@vectren.com	"ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 2011, AT 2:06 PM, VECTREN ENERGY DELIVERY OF OHIO WAS NOTIFIED BY THE CITY OF  FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT OF A HOUSE EXPLOSION AT 367/369 WAYNE DRIVE IN FAIRBORN.  VECTREN PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THE VALVE TO THE SERVICE LINE PROVIDING NATURAL GAS TO THE STRUCTURE.     AN INITIAL REPORT FROM THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT INDICATED THE STRUCTURE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS ¿TOTALLY DESTROYED AND REDUCED TO A FLAMING PILE OF RUBBLE¿.  IT FURTHER DESCRIBED THE DAMAGE TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES INCLUDING BLOWN OUT WINDOWS, A COLLAPSED EXTERIOR WALL AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF FIRE TO THE ROOF LINES.     THE INITIAL REPORT ALSO COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE REMAINS UNDER INVESTIGATION, THE PRELIMINARY THOUGHT IS THAT ¿EXCAVATION WORK AROUND A NATURAL GAS LINE CAUSED THE LINE TO FRACTURE ON THE INSIDE OF THE BASEMENT WALL¿¿ ¿ALLOWING THE FREE FLOW OF GAS TO FILL THE INTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE AND A UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE SPARKED THE EXPLOSION.¿    VECTREN IS CONTINUING ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN OF THIS INCIDENT.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT NARRATIVE, JANUARY 10, 2012:    THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE FOR THE DUPLEX AT 367-369 WAYNE DRIVE RAN UNDERGROUND FROM THE CURB BOX THROUGH THE CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  AFTER GOING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE BASEMENT WALL, THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE THEN WENT TO THE LEFT AT A TEE CONNECTION TO THE METER FOR 367 WAYNE DRIVE AND THEN TO THE RIGHT AT AN NINETY DEGREE ELBOW THROUGH THE BLOCK WALL, DIVIDING THE BASEMENTS, TO THE METER FOR 369 WAYNE DRIVE.      VECTREN GENERALLY CONCLUDES THAT THE BACKHOE OPERATOR, DIGGING A TRENCH OUTSIDE THE BASEMENT FOUNDATION BETWEEN THE SIDEWALK AND THE DUPLEX, DAMAGED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE.  THIS DAMAGE CAUSED THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE TO BEND AND PULL AND TO PLACE A LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION ON THE GAS SERVICE LINE AND THE THREADS THAT SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW INSIDE THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF TENSION CAUSED THE THREADS OF THE GAS SERVICE LINE, WHICH WERE SCREWED INTO THE NINETY DEGREE ELBOW, TO FRACTURE AT THIS THREAD JOINT RELEASING NATURAL GAS INTO THE BASEMENT OF 367 WAYNE DRIVE.  THE NATURAL GAS EXPLODED FROM AN UNDETERMINED IGNITION SOURCE ONCE THE NATURAL GAS AND AIR MIXTURE HAD REACHED A POINT BETWEEN THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT AND THE UPPER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT.  THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION DID NOT CAUSE THE FRACTURE TO THIS THREAD JOINT.      VECTREN¿S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF MERCAPTAN OR ODORANT WAS IN THE NATURAL GAS AT THE TIME AND THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER NATURAL GAS LEAKS.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND LEAK TIGHT.  VECTREN¿S INVESTIGATION ALSO DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO REQUESTS TO LOCATE THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE BEFORE THESE UNFORTUNATE EVENTS AND THAT THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO TURN OFF THE NATURAL GAS.  ALTHOUGH VECTREN DOES NOT RELY ON THE INITIAL REPORT OF THE FAIRBORN FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE INCIDENT REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL, VECTREN¿S CONCLUSIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THESE REPORTS."

THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCEDURE WAS TO DISPOSE OF A BUILD-UP OF NATURAL GAS (DETERMINED LATER TO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A MIXTURE OR AIR AND GAS) IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE BY TRANSFERRING IT AT 10 PSIG INTO MICHCON'S GRAND RAPIDS/WALKER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RATHER THAN RELEASING IT TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND FLARING (BURNING) THE GAS.  THE PROCEDURE WAS EXECUTED PRECISELY AS WRITTEN AND APPROVED BY MICHCON ENGINEERING.    AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 AM, WHILE THE PRESSURE REDUCTION PROCEDURE WAS STILL IN PROGRESS, MICHCON BEGAN TO RECEIVE ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS FROM CUSTOMERS SERVED BY THE SURROUNDING 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM, MICHCON PERSONNEL REALIZED THERE HAD BEEN AN AIR AND GAS MIXTURE IN THE 22-INCH PIPELINE, RATHER THAN GAS.  PRESSURE REDUCTION OPERATIONS WERE HALTED IMMEDIATELY.    MICHCON ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY CONVENED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED AREA AND THE SOURCE OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE.  MICHCON DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 5500 CUSTOMERS OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 10 SQUARE MILES COULD ULTIMATELY BE AFFECTED.  HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE INITIAL OUTAGE REPORTS AT 10:15 AM AND THE EARLY AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 17, THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT 100 ""NO-GAS"" REPORTS.  THIS NUMBER GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 350 OUTAGE REPORTS BY 8 PM AS CUSTOMERS RETURNED HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY.  AT 8 PM MICHCON MANAGEMENT DECLARED THIS A ""SIGNIFICANT EVENT"" AND A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.     CREWS WERE MOBILIZED FROM MICHCON REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF MICHIGAN TO MAKE A DOOR-TO-DOOR INVESTIGATION OF EVERY CUSTOMER PREMISES IN THE AFFECTED AREA TO ENSURE THAT GAS SERVICE WAS BEING RESTORED AND THAT ALL APPLIANCES WERE OPERATING PROPERLY.  MICHCON ENGINEERS DEVELOPED A PLAN TO SYSTEMATICALLY PURGE THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE FROM THE 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, AND INDIVIDUAL SERVICE LINES WERE PURGED OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE WHEREVER IT WAS FOUND.  BY FRIDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2011, EVERY CUSTOMER HAD EITHER BEEN CONTACTED OR THEIR PREMISES WERE ENTERED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCKSMITHS TO CONFIRM THAT GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN RESTORED.  THERE WERE NO FIRES, EXPLOSIONS, OR INJURIES REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED THE FORMATION OF THE AIR/GAS MIXTURE INSIDE THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF THE 22-INCH 238 PSIG PIPELINE BEGAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SEGMENT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE DURING AUGUST 2011.  THE 22-INCH PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUT IN BETWEEN MICHCON'S SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION TO THE WEST AND THE NEW COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION ON THE EAST END OF THE 22-INCH PIPELINE SEGMENT.  THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF PIPELINE HAD BEEN EVACUATED AND PURGED OF GAS, THEN CAPPED OFF AT THE COLLINDALE REGULATING STATION SITE WHILE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATION WAS COMPLETED.     A 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE AT THE SOUTH GRAND RAPIDS GATE STATION THAT WAS USED TO ISOLATE THE WEST END OF THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE ALLOWED GAS TO SLOWLY BLEED PAST THE VALVE SEAT, MIXING WITH THE AIR LEFT IN THE PURGED SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2011.  THE MICHCON ENGINEER WHO DEVELOPED THE WRITTEN PROCEDURE FOR OCTOBER 17 RECOGNIZED THAT THE GAS BLEEDING THROUGH THE 22-INCH BLOCK VALVE WAS CREATING A PRESSURE BUILD-UP, BUT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD CREATE AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE THAT WOULD BE UNFIT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO CUSTOMERS.    MICHCON HAS DETERMINED APPROXIMATELY 136,000 CUBIC FEET OF AN AIR/GAS MIXTURE HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE 2.5-MILE SECTION OF 22-INCH PIPELINE.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS MIXTURE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE SURROUNDING 10 PSIG DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DURING THE PROCEDURE EXECUTED ON OCTOBER 17, 2011, RESULTING IN THE CUSTOMER OUTAGES."

THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER, WHILE WEARING A SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR, PREPARED THE CAST IRON MAIN FOR INSTALLATION OF A 6-INCH BY 9-INCHES IN LENGTH PIPE REPAIR CLAMP.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER INSTALLED THE CLAMP AND TIGHTENED THE BOLTS TO STOP THE LEAK.  THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER REMOVED THE SUPPLIED AIR-RESPIRATOR FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. THEREAFTER, HE PROCEEDED TO FINISH TIGHTENING THE BOLTS AND SOAP CHECK THE PIPE TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  AT THAT TIME, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN LEFT THE TOP OF THE EXCAVATION AND WENT TO THE TRUCK TO RETRIEVE COATING FOR THE REPAIR CLAMP WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF GAS BLOWING FROM THE EXCAVATION.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER KNEELING FACE DOWN OVER THE GAS MAIN AND UNRESPONSIVE TO VERBAL COMMANDS.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO AND CALLED 911.  GROSSE POINTE FARMS POLICE AND EMS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PULLED THE DISTRIBUTION GENERAL FITTER FROM THE EXCAVATION; HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ST.

A SECOND REPAIR CREW WAS CALLED IN TO REPAIR THE GAS MAIN FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND INSTALLED A 6-INCH BY 12-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP ADJACENT TO THE FIRST REPAIR CLAMP;  HOWEVER THE CLAMP FURTHER CRUSHED THE CORRODED/WEAKENED PIPE.   BOTH REPAIR CLAMPS WERE REMOVED AND A 6-INCH BY 30-INCHES IN LENGTH REPAIR CLAMP WAS INSTALLED TO REPAIR THE LEAK.     ON NOVEMBER 1, 2011, THE PIPE WAS REMOVED AND RECOVERED FOR EXAMINATION AND A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS BY A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY.  THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT LOCALIZED GRAPHITIC CORROSION WEAKENED THE FRACTURED PIECES OF PIPE THAT WERE CRUSHED WHEN TIGHTENING THE REPAIR CLAMPS."

THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE AND REPAIRS WERE MADE.  INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY A CRACKED SERVICE TEE CAP.  SUBSEQUENT AERATION ACTIVITIES WERE PERFORMED TO REMOVE THE NATURAL GAS FROM THE SOIL.  THE AERATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LEAK EXCEEDED THE INCIDENT REPORTING THRESHOLD OF $50,000 ON NOVEMBER 17, 2011.      THE MANUFACTURER INSTALLATION PROCEDURES FOR THE CRACKED SERVICE TEE CAP STATE THAT THESE TYPES OF CAPS ARE DESIGNED TO BE HAND TIGHTENED ONLY.  THE CRACKED CAP FROM THIS FAILURE HAS WRENCH MARKS.  BASED ON THIS EVIDENCE, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CAP FAILURE WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY OVER TIGHTENING OF THE CAP."

THE GSR OBSERVED A HOUSE STRUCTURE ON FIRE AS WELL AS FLAMES IN THE LANDSCAPE AREA IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  THE HOMEOWNER INDICATED SHE NOTICED THE SMELL OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 0800 HOURS THAT MORNING BUT DID NOT THINK MUCH ABOUT IT AND LEFT HER RESIDENCE AT APPROXIMATELY 1130 HOURS.  THE HOMEOWNER DID NOT NOTIFY PG&E OF THE OBSERVED SMELL OF GAS.  A GAS CONSTRUCTION CREW ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1251 HOURS, AND THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED BY EXCAVATING AND SQUEEZING THE PLASTIC MAIN AT THREE LOCATIONS. GAS SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED TO SEVEN CUSTOMERS.  SERVICE TO ONE AFFECTED RESIDENCE WAS RESTORED WHEN STRUCTURE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  SERVICE TO THE REMAINING SIX CUSTOMERS WERE RESTORED BY 1400 HOURS ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2011.  EXCAVATION OF THE PLASTIC GAS DISTRIBUTION MAIN REVEALED A CRACK IN A 2-INCH ALDYL A PLASTIC TEE, WHICH WAS THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK.  THE TEE FAILED AS A RESULT OF STRESS RISERS FORMED IN THE TEE MATERIAL FROM THE STEPWISE INCREASE IN WALL THICKNESS WHERE THE COUPLING AND SERVICE PIPE FIRST BOND.  THE FRACTURE PROPOGATED BY SLOW CRACK GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE SYSTEM PRESSURE.  GAS FROM THE LEAKING TEE MIGRATED UNDERGROUND TO THE GARAGE OF THE RESIDENCE AND CAUGHT FIRE FROM THE PILOT LIGHT OF THE FURNACE IN THE GARAGE. PG&E CONDUCTED LEAK SURVEYS AT THE 422 TOWNHOUSE COMPLEX WHERE 20299 NORTHWEST SQUARE IS LOCATED IN APRIL AND MAY OF 2011.  A REVIEW OF THE LEAK SURVEY RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY ISSUES AT THIS RESIDENCE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LEAKS DETECTED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COMPLEX.  LEAK SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT, AND SIX LEAKS WERE IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED THROUGHOUT THE COMPLEX.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.

HAS RULED THAT WAS NOT THE INITIATING CAUSE OF THE EVENT.  THE CITY OF RICHMOND PERFORMED A SERIES OF TESTS WHICH INCLUDED A LEAK SURVEY OF THE OUTER PERIMETER OF THE BUILDING, BAR HOLE TEST, AND A PRESSURE TEST OF THE GAS SERVICE.  DURING THE FIRE, THE RISER, REGULATOR, AND METER WERE DESTROYED, WHICH CAUSED A LEAK ON THE RISER THAT SHOWED UP DURING THE PRESSURE TEST OF THE SERVICE.  A TEST OF THE RISER DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE HEAT FROM THE FIRE.  ALSO, THE CITY OF RICHMOND, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES, HAD AN ODOROMETER TEST PERFORMED BY THE SUPERVISOR OF PRESSURE CONTROL AND FOUND THE ODORANT TO BE IN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE."

AFTER THE PIPE WAS CUT, THE SAWS-ALL IGNITED THE BLOWING GAS UNDER THE HOUSE. AT THIS TIME, THE FIRE DEPT. WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FIRE.  THE FIREMEN WERE INJURED AFTER THE GAS FIRE WAS OUT HOWEVER IT REIGNITED TWICE BY THE BURNING WOOD IN THE HOUSE, FLASHING THE TWO FIREMEN BEFORE THEY COULD DRIVE A WOODEN PLUG INTO THE OPEN GAS RISER.  GAS MAINTENANCE CREWS WERE NOTIFIED TO CUT SERVICE OFF IN THE SIDEWALK AREA."

DAMAGE TO THE MAIN OCCURRED WHEN A 2 INCH SERVICE TEE WAS STRUCK, PULLING IT OFF THE MAIN.  CONTRACT LOCATOR'S MARKS WERE 19 INCHES FROM THE MAIN. HOWEVER, THE EXCAVATOR WAS ABLE TO HAND DIG AND LOCATE THE MAIN AS REQUIRED.  THE EXCAVATOR THEN PROCEEDED TO USE A BACKHOE TO EXCAVATE A TRENCH PARALLEL TO BUT NOT ADJACENT TO THE MAIN WITHOUT FURTHER EXPOSING THE GAS PIPE.    THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE EXCAVATOR'S FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROBE FOR THE MAIN AND APPURTENANCES AS HE PROGRESSED AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL EXPOSED SECTION IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE MAIN.  NEW JERSEY CODE REQUIRES PROPER CARE AND ADEQUATE SUPERVISION BE USED TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE UNDERGROUND FACILITY AFTER LOCATING THE FACILITY BY HAND (REF. N.J.A.C.14-2-3.3).  THE CLOSE PROXIMITY AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE DAMAGED FACILITY SUGGESTS NO CLOSE SUPERVISION OF THE MECHANICAL EXCAVATION WAS BEING PRACTICED ALTHOUGH THE EXCAVATOR KNEW THE EXCAVATION WAS BEING PERFORMED WITHIN INCHES OF THE GAS MAIN AND ITS LIKELY APPURTENANCES.  THE TEE WAS RIPPED COMPLETELY FROM THE MAIN, INDICATING CONSIDERABLE FORCE WAS APPLIED.    THE NEARBY NJ TRANSIT & AMTRAK NE CORRIDOR TRACKS WERE SHUT DOWN FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS.  WEST JERSEY STREET WAS CLOSED BETWEEN CHERRY STREET AND BROAD STREET AND THE KELLOGG BUILDING OF UNION COUNTY COLLEGE WAS EVACUATED (APPROX 100 PEOPLE).

THE GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER (GERC) DISPACTHED GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND SUPERVISORS TO THE LOCATION. THE LEAK WAS INVESTIGATED AND A 1"" LUBRICATING VALVE ON A DRIP RISER WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. THE VALVE WAS SERVICED AND THE LEAK SECURED. THE AREA OF WORK WAS LEFT PLATED AND SECURED OVERNIGHT. ON APRIL 19, 2011, THE LOCATION WAS SURVEILLED DURING AN INSPECTION OF THE PIPING AND A LEAK CONDITION WAS FOUND. AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED WAS IMPLEMENTED AFTER A LEAK ON A 1"" DRIP RISER COMPRESSION COUPLING AT THE INLET OF THIS REGULATOR STATION WAS DETECTED.  THE PLAN CALLED FOR ISOLATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF GR-498 (212 PSI INLET) WHICH SUPPLIES A 60 PSI HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. THE EFFECTED SECTION OF TRANSMISSION PRESSURE PIPE WAS ISOLATED, DEPRESSURIZED AND THE LEAK CONDITION ELIMINATED. THERE WAS NO REDUCTION IN PRESSURE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM, OR LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS. GAS CONSTRUCTION, GDS, PRESSURE CONTROL AND TRANSMISSION ENGINEERING REMAINED ON LOCATION UNTIL WORK WAS COMPLETED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE STANDPIPE AND COUPLING AND THE INSTALLATION OF A WELDED HIGH-HAT.

DEO ENGAGED A THIRD PART TESTING AGENCY WHO CONDUCTED A TEST USING AN IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED DRESSER 711 END CAP INSTALLED IN AN IDENTICAL MANNER AS THE END CAP WAS INSTALLED AT THE E. 90TH STREET INCIDENT LOCATION.  THE IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED DRESSER 711 END CAP HELD OPERATING PRESSURE FOR A DURATION OF 24 HOURS.  THE TEST ENDED WITHOUT LEAK OR ANY FORM OF FAILURE; THE COUPLING DID NOT MOVE RELATIVE TO THE PIPE.  THIS TEST CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DRESSER 711 END CAP REMAINED INTACT AND DID NOT FAIL UNDER OPERATING PRESSURE AND THEREFORE DEO CANNOT, WITH CERTAINTY, DEEM THE IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED END CAP AS THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.    AS AN ADDITIONAL MATTER, THERE WAS A SEPARATE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTY OWNER ALREADY UNDERWAY AT THE TIME OF THE GAS RELATED INCIDENT.

FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS AT SCENE.  HOUSE WAS IN FLAMES AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS USING HOSES TO CONTROL FIRE.  WHEN IT WAS SAFE, CREW APPROACHED OUTSIDE RISER TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS BROKEN ABOVE OR BELOW THE SHUT OFF VALVE.  THE ENTIRE METER ASSEMBLY WAS BURIED WITH SNOW, ICE AND ASH WHEN THEY APPROACHED.  07:45 GAS WAS SHUT OFF AT RISER USING A LONG HANDLED VALVE KEY.  THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE FLAMES HOWEVER DID NOT STOP THE FIRE.

ALL WALL CHECKS WERE CLEAR.  08:00 GAS CREW BEGAN DIGGING SERVICE AT MAIN TO SHUT OFF GAS.  08:42 GAS SERVICE WAS SHUT OFF AT TEE.  UPON SHUT DOWN, FIRE IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED.    FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION:    IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION WAS TAKEN:    - A GAS SAMPLE WAS TAKEN AT THE NEIGHBORING HOUSE (501 CAYUGA ST) TO CHECK MERCAPTIN LEVELS.  TWO TESTS WERE COMPLETED USING BACKARACH ODOROMETER (ID# AIS367).  THE RESULTS WERE:  - .15 (TESTED BY ANDY HECKATHORN)  - .25 (TESTED PHILIP NATOLI)  - ABOVE GROUND SERVICE PIPING, INCLUDING CUSTOMER FUEL LINE, WAS INSPECTED FOR DAMAGE.  THE ENTIRE METER ASSEMBLY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BENT FORWARD.  THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE REGULATOR, AND METER DUE TO THE FIRE.  CUSTOMER FUEL LINE WAS VERY LOOSE BUT STILL INTACT.  A CRACK WAS FOUND ON THE NIPPLE BETWEEN THE REDUCER AND THE BOTTOM OF THE SHUT OFF VALVE.  - SERVICE RISER WAS CAPPED, AND LINE WAS RE-ENERGIZED.  AN UNDERGROUND LEAK SURVEY WAS COMPLETED USING TWO CALIBRATED COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS (ID #052010 AND #052010).  ZERO GAS READINGS WERE FOUND.  - THE SERVICE LINE WAS PRESSURE TESTED WITH AIR AT 22PSI FOR 15 MINUTES, WITH NO DROP IN LINE PRESSURE.  - AFTER TESTING WAS COMPLETED, THE SERVICE LINE WAS PERMANENTLY RETIRED AT THE MAIN.  - JIM CLARY FROM THE NG CLAIMS DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS DENNIS WARE FROM WARE INVESTIGATIONS ARRIVED TO INVESTIGATE AND DOCUMENT THE EVENT.    PRELIMINARY REPORT:    CONSENSUS WITH THE LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE INVESTIGATORS AS WELL AS NG PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT ICE AND SNOW SHED FROM THE ROOF OF THE RESIDENCE CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE SERVICE PIPING RESULTING IN THE LEAK.  THE MOST LIKELY IGNITION SOURCE OCCURRED FROM THE FURNACE WHICH WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET FROM THE SERVICE RISER."

THE CUSTOMER AT THIS FACILITY HAD REMOVED SNOW ACCUMULATED ON THE ROOF OUT OF CONCERN THAT THE SNOW LOAD WOULD COLLAPSE THE ROOF. THE SNOW WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROOF AND DEPOSITED ON THE GROUND SURROUNDING THE BUILDING INCLUDING THE METER LOCATION. WHEN COMPANY PERSONNEL ARRIVED ONSITE THE SNOW AT THE METER SET WAS 10 FEET HIGH.    THE FORCE OF THE SNOW BEING DROPPED FROM THE ROOF STRESSED THE PIPING FROM THE METER VALVE AT THE TOP OF THE SERVICE RISER TO THE REGULATOR CAUSING THE THREADED NIPPLE TO CRACK AT THE THREADS.

FIRE WAS DETECTED AROUND THE SERVICE RISER TO THE BUILDING AND WE WERE NOTIFIED BY WICOMICO COUNTY 911 CENTER. OUR ON-CALL METER TECH RESPONDED AND NOTED THAT THE GREASE HAD MELTED OUT OF THE 3/4"" SERVICE STOP AND DETECTED THE SMELL OF GAS. HE NOTICED THAT SOME GAS WAS BUBBLING THROUGH THE WATER FROM THE SERVICE RISER NEAR THE FENCE. HE CALLED OUT OUR ON-CALL CONSTRUCTION CREW WHO HAND DUG AROUND THE RISER AND SQUEEZED OFF THE 3/4"" PE SERVICE AND CAPPED IT OFF. THEY DUG THE RISER OUT AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE SHOP FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THE INSERTED TUBE WAS CUT OFF THE RISER AND SHOWED A SMALL PINHOLE THAT HAD FORMED DUE TO THE HEAT. THE GAS FROM THE PINHOLE TRAVELLED DOWN THE CASING PIPE AND OUT THE BOOT AND VENTED THROUGH THE GROUND AND WATER PUDDLES BUT DID NOT IGNITE. MARYLAND STATE FIRE MARSHALL S. P. MASON INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT AND CONCLUDED THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE WAS AN EXTENSION CORD GOING TO A BATTERY TRICKLE CHARGER ON A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN THE STRUCTURE AND THAT NATURAL GAS WAS NOT A CAUSE. THE BUILDING CONTAINED A BACKHOE, SEVERAL TRACTORS, COMPRESSORS, ZERO-TURN LAWN MOWERS, ETC. WHICH WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. THE INCIDENT WAS REALIZED AT 11:06 AS A RESULT OF OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE DAMAGES BY THE FIELD OPERATIONS MANAGER AND WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL CALL CENTER AT 11:16.

GAS IS SUPPLIED THROUGH THREE DISTRICT REGULATOR STATIONS FROM THE NORTHEAST, EAST AND SOUTHWEST AREAS OF THE VILLAGE.  THESE THREE STATIONS CONTAIN TWO CONTROL/MONITOR REGULATORS SET AT 6.5 OUNCES (OZ) AND 8.5 OUNCES PER SQUARE INCH GAUGE RESPECTIVELY.  THE NORTHEAST STATION IS EQUIPPED WITH A HI-LO FOR MONITORING SYSTEM PRESSURE THAT IS SET AT 8.5 OZ AND 4.5 OZ RESPECTIVELY.  THE EAST STATION ALSO CONTAINS A RELIEF DEVICE FOR AUDIBLE WARNING SET AT 12OZ.      AT APPROXIMATELY 6:37 A.M. ON 01/24/2011, DOMINION RECEIVED A HIGH ALARM FROM THE HI-LO MONITOR AT THE NORTHEAST STATION.    A TECHNICIAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  THE TECHNICIAN NOTED THE RELIEF BLOWING AS HE PASSED THE EAST STATION AND NOTIFIED SUPERVISION.  THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED AT THE NORTHEAST STATION AT 7:15 A.M., AND SHUT THE INLET VALVE TO THE NORTHEAST STATION.  HE PROCEEDED TO THE EAST STATION, SHUT THE INLET VALVE AND OBTAINED A SYSTEM PRESSURE READING OF 8.5 PSIG.  SUPERVISION WAS UPDATED THAT THE NORTHEAST AND EAST STATIONS WERE NOT SUPPLYING GAS, AND BOTH STATIONS HAD BEEN SHUT-IN.    SUPERVISION ADVISED THE TECHNICIAN TO OPEN THE INLET TO THE EAST STATION AND PROCEED TO THE SOUTHWEST STATION.  UPON ARRIVAL HE NOTED THE SOUTHWEST STATION WAS SUPPLYING GAS AND SHUT THE INLET VALVE.  SUPERVISION ADVISED HIM TO RETURN TO THE EAST STATION AND MONITOR THE SYSTEM PRESSURE.  AT 8:05 A.M. THE TECHNICIAN RETURNED TO THE EAST STATION AND NOTED THE RELIEF HAD STOPPED BLOWING.  HE VERIFIED THAT SYSTEM PRESSURE HAD RETURNED TO 6.5OZ.      LEAK SURVEY OF THE FAIRPORT HARBOR SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED ON 01/24/2011 AND REPEATED ON 01/25/2011.  CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE CREWS REPAIRED ALL HAZARDOUS LEAKS UPON DISCOVERY AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON REPAIR OF NON-HAZARDOUS LEAKS.      DOMINION FIELD PERSONNEL REMAINED IN THE AREA OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS, RESTORING SERVICE TO 1300 AFFECTED CUSTOMERS.  DOMINION HAS WORKED WITH FAIRPORT HARBOR VILLAGE OFFICIALS AND THE AMERICAN RED CROSS PROVIDING HOUSING AND SHORT-TERM FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE IN NEED UNTIL SERVICE RESTORATION.  ELEVEN HOMES RECEIVED SEVERE DAMAGE FROM FIRE AND 150 HOMES REQUIRED APPLIANCE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT.  DOMINION AND ITS CONTRACTORS HAVE PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY HOUSE LINE REPAIRS, APPLIANCE REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENT.  FOR NINE STRUCTURES CONSIDERED TO BE UNINHABITABLE, DOMINION CONTINUES TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RESOLVING CUSTOMER CLAIMS.      DOMINION WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO, FAIRPORT HARBOR FIRE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATORS AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IN REMOVING THE REGULATORS AND OTHER ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT FROM THE SOUTHWEST STATION.  THE STATION EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO THE GAS TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE (GTI) FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION.    AFTER GTI REMOVED AN OILY SUBSTANCE AND CLEANED THE COMPONENTS WITH ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, THE REGULATORS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WERE TESTED IN JUNE AND AUGUST WITH ALL OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES PRESENT.  THE REGULATING EQUIPMENT WAS DETERMINED TO FUNCTION AS DESIGNED DURING INCREASING AND DECREASING FLOW AND PRESSURE CONDITIONS.  THE REGULATING EQUIPMENT WAS FOUND TO OPERATE PROPERLY WITH THE FLUIDS REMOVED.  IT IS CURRENTLY BELIEVED THAT THE PRESENCE OF PIPELINE FLUIDS AND GAS TEMPERATURE DROP ACROSS THE REGULATORS CAUSED THE REGULATORS TO MALFUNCTION."

THE MAIN VALVE BOX WAS VENTED AND THE 50% READING DISSIPATED. THIS VALVE IS AN ELASTOSEAL VALVE WHICH COULD NOT BE SERVICED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF V-3530 AND CONTINGENCY PLANS WERE PUT IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY TO THE MANHATTAN HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THE 30"" TRANSMISSION MAIN, SUPPLYING THE 4"" INLET TO GR-80, WOULD HAVE TO BE SHUTDOWN. THE CONTINGENCY PLAN CALLED FOR THE 59 ST. GENERATING STATION AS WELL AS INTERRUPTIBLE GAS CUSTOMERS TO CEASE GAS USAGE.  THE AREA OF THE INLET PIPING TO GR-80 WAS EXCAVATED AND A CONTROL FITTING AND VARIOUS FITTINGS WERE WELDED, TAPPED AND THE 4"" INLET MAIN STOPPED-OFF SUCCESSFULLY. THE 4"" MAIN WAS DEPRESSURIZED AND  V-3530 WAS EXCAVATED AND THE VALVE AND ASSOCIATED PIPING WERE CUT AND REMOVED. THE 5' REPLACEMENT SECTION (INCLUDING NEW INLET VALVE) WAS SUCCESSFULLY WELDED AND X-RAYED. WELDED HIGH-HATS WERE INSTALLED AND SUCCESSFULLY MAG-PARTICLE TESTED OVER VARIOUS FITTINGS.  AT 20:32 HRS 1-19-11, THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE.  REGULATOR STATION GR-80 WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE AT 2000 HRS.  THIS WAS A SERIOUS LEVEL INCIDENT.

CURRENTLY SERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ALL CUSTOMERS.     COLUMBIA'S CAUSE AND ORIGIN INVESTIGATORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF A CROSS ARM FAILURE FROM OUR ELECTRICAL PROVIDER'S NEARBY POWER POLE.  THE HIGH VOLTAGE PRIMARY CONDUCTORS (LINES) FELL INTO THE SECONDARY ELECTRICAL DROP SERVING COLUMBIA'S REGULATOR STATION BUILDING AND ENERGIZED THE NEUTRAL TO 7200 VOLTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A FAULT CURRENT THAT TRAVELED VIA ALL AVAILABLE GROUND PATHS TO STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES LOCATED INSIDE THE STATION.  THE SUBSEQUENT ELECTRICAL ARCING RESULTED IN HOLES BEING BURNED IN THE STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES WHICH RELEASED GAS THAT WAS IGNITED BY THE ELECTRICAL ARCING, RESULTING IN THE INITIAL PHASE OF THIS FIRE.      ONCE THE GAS-FED FIRE IGNITED WITHIN THE REGULATOR STATION FROM THE ELECTRICALLY DAMAGED STAINLESS STEEL CONTROL LINES AND CONTROL BOX, THE FIRE FROM THE CONTROL LINES BURNED THE GASKETS OUT OF THE LARGE DIAMETER PIPE FLANGES AND A MUCH LARGER FIRE  ENSUED FED BY THE 130 PSIG GAS.

THE ILLINOIS STATE FIRE MARSHAL INVESTIGATOR INFORMED THE AMEREN ILLINOIS SUPERVISOR GAS OPERATIONS THAT HIS INITIAL INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE FIRE STARTED IN THE KITCHEN/DINING AREA.  THE TRASH AND CLUTTER IN THIS AREA WAS IGNITED BY ONE OF THE THREE ELECTRIC SPACE HEATERS THAT WERE IN THE AREA.  IT WAS ALSO STATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN ONE FATALITY DUE TO BURNS AND SMOKE INHALATION.  THE SUPERVISOR MADE NECESSARY CONTACTS AFTER LEARNING THIS FACT AND AMEREN ILLINOIS THEN DETERMINED THIS TO BE A REPORTABLE INCIDENT AT 13:10.  NECESSARY INFORMATION WAS GATHERED AND THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC AT 15:00.      PLEASE NOTE: IN PART A OF THIS REPORT, 17 A. LOCAL TIME OPERATOR IDENTIFIED INCIDENT IS LISTED AS 05:40 WHICH IS THE TIME THE EMERGENCY CALL WAS RECEIVED AND NOT THE TIME AMEREN ILLINOIS DETERMINED THIS TO BE A REPORTABLE INCIDENT SINCE THE LOGIC BUILT INTO THIS DATA ENTRY FORM REQUIRES THE DATE AND TIME IN 17 B. LOCAL TIME OPERATOR RESOURCES ARRIVED ON SITE TO BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO OPERATOR IDENTIFIED DATE AND TIME IN 17 A.      A COPY OF THE JACKSONVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORT WAS OBTAINED AND FORWARDED ON TO THE ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION CONFIRMING THE AREA OF ORIGIN TO BE IN THE KITCHEN/DINING AREA AND THAT THE POSSIBLE CAUSE IS SUSPECTED TO BE A ""SPACE HEATER FOUND HEAVILY DAMAGED IN THAT LOCATION""."

THE LEAK WAS CLASSIFIED TYPE-1 DUE TO THE PROXIMITY TO THE 24"" TRANSMISSION MAIN (230 PSI). GAS CONSTRUCTION CREWS AND SUPERVISION RESPONDED, INVESTIGATED AND AT 1536 HRS IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK MAY BE COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION MAIN. THE 12"" 1957 STEEL TRANSMISSION INLET TO GAS REGULATOR GR-514 WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IN THE VICINITY OF A DRIP POT AND RISER. GR-514 WAS VALVED OFF AND THE LEAK EXCAVATED AFTER PRESSURE WAS BLED DOWN. THE EXCAVATION DETERMINED THE ACTUAL SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS ON A 1"" COUPLING IN THE DRIP RISER AT THE INLET PIPING TO GR-514. PRESSURE CONTROL, GAS CONTROL AND GAS ENGINEERING DETERMINED THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY NEGATIVE SYSTEM IMPACT DUE TO THE LOSS OF THIS TRANSMISSION PRESSURE TO HIGH PRESSURE REGULATOR STATION.   TRANSMISSION VALVES 25960 AND 28563 WERE CLOSED AT 1705 HRS AND PRESSURE REDUCTION THROUGH GR-514.

CENTERVILLE IS LOCATED IN APPANOOSE COUNTY.  CONDITIONS THAT MORNING WERE CLEAR AND SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND 65 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.     AT APPROXIMATELY 8:48 AM CST, INTERSTATE POWER & LIGHT'S (IPL) DISTRIBUTION DISPATCH CENTER IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IA RECEIVED A CALL FROM EMPLOYEES IN IPL'S CENTERVILLE CALL CENTER WITH A REPORT OF AN ELECTRICAL OUTAGE AND A HOUSE FIRE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CALL CENTER BUILDING.  AN ELECTRIC LINEMAN WAS DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:05 AM, A CALL ALSO CAME IN FROM THE CENTERVILLE POLICE/FIRE DISPATCHER REPORTING A HOUSE FIRE. WHEN THE IPL LINEMAN ARRIVED ONSITE AT 9:20 AM, THE VALVE AT THE GAS METER SET HAD BEEN SHUT OFF BY FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL.  AT THIS POINT, THE SITUATION APPEARED TO BE A HOUSE FIRE CAUSED BY A SQUIRREL MAKING CONTACT WITH AN ENERGIZED SWITCH ON A POLE AT THE REAR OF 1202 DRAKE AVENUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAULT AND BREAKER OPERATIONS THAT INTRODUCED HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRICITY INTO THE HOME'S ELECTRICAL WIRING SYSTEM.       AT APPROXIMATELY 9:25 AM, DURING FIREFIGHTING ACTIVITIES, A ""WHOOSH"" OR ""FLASH"" OCCURRED, INDICATING AN IGNITION OF GAS.  AT THIS POINT, FLAMES ALSO APPEARED ALONG THE GROUND NEAR THE HOUSE.  GAS EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON SITE AT 9:32 AM.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:25 AM, GAS TO THE RESIDENCE WAS SHUT OFF BY EXCAVATING OVER THE SERVICE TAP AND OPERATING THE EXISTING SERVICE TEE.    SIX FIREFIGHTERS SOUGHT MEDICAL TREATMENT DUE TO THE GAS IGNITION.  THREE OF THEM WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OVERNIGHT OBSERVATION AND RELEASED THE NEXT DAY.     AN IOWA UTILITIES BOARD INVESTIGATOR, ALONG WITH A STATE FIRE INVESTIGATOR, VISITED THE SITE ON THE AFTERNOON OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 AND WITNESSED THE EXCAVATION AND REMOVAL OF A SEGMENT OF THE SERVICE LINE.  INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE THAT AN ELECTRICAL ARC BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL SERVICE LINE CONDUIT AND THE STEEL GAS SERVICE BURNED A HOLE IN BOTH, ALLOWING GAS TO MIGRATE INTO THE ALREADY BURNING STRUCTURE VIA THE CONDUIT AND INTO THE ELECTRIC SERVICE PANEL.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE EXISTING FIRE IN THE STRUCTURE.     THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TELEPHONICALLY TO KEVIN WILLIAMS OF THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT APPROXIMATELY 10:01 CST ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 BY JIM HOUSE, MANAGER GAS DISTRIBUTION AND METERING. (CASE #955252)  THE INCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2010, BECAUSE IT WAS REPORTED TO MR. HOUSE AS A HOUSE FIRE THAT WAS LATER FED BY NATURAL GAS. THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF AN EXPLOSIVE OR VIOLENT GAS IGNITION.  AFTER READING THE NEWS ACCOUNTS ON MONDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 DESCRIBING IT AS A GAS EXPLOSION, MR. HOUSE IMMEDIATELY MADE THE TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.  IN MR. HOUSE'S FOLLOW-UP DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. LOPEZ FROM THE PHMSA OFFICE IN HOUSTON, MR. LOPEZ AGREED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE A ""FIRE FIRST, GAS SECOND"" SCENARIO.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT (02/03/2011):  NO CHANGES TO INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED.

THE CALL WAS RECEIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM BY AMANDA BRIDGES. SHE DISPATCHED THE INFORMATION TO THE GAS DEPARTMENT FOR INVESTIGATION.  JAMES YOUNG, BRUCE BURGESS, BUSTER FELTON, AND MARIO BYRD PERFORMED THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AT KEITH-A-QUE, WHICH IS LOCATED AT 249 EAST WASHINGTON AVE. DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION GAS PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. ASHBURN GAS SUPERINTENDENT ROGER GIDDENS REPORTED TO THEIR LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00AM TO HELP DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. DURING THE INVESTIGATION OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT TOWN REPORTED HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS. PROPANE ODOR WAS DETERMINED TO BE PRESENT WITHIN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM.   AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00PM CITY PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT PROPANE WAS BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM FROM FOUR 500 GALLON PROPANE TANKS CONNECTED TO A FUEL LINE AT THE HAT CREEK PEANUT COMPANY INC. LOCATED AT 465 BUSSEY ROAD, SYCAMORE GA. 31790.  LATER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS METERED SERVICE WAS DELIVERING LINE PRESSURE TO THE HAT CREEK PER AGREEMENT BETWEEN ASHBURN AND HAT CREEK.  HAT CREEK CONNECTED THE PROPANE TANKS TO ITS INTERNAL PIPING IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPLEMENT ITS NATURAL GAS SUPPLY DURING HIGH DEMAND PERIODS.  THE ABSENCE OF A SERVICE REGULATOR AT THE METER ALLOWED THE HIGHER-PRESSURE PROPANE TO FLOW BACKWARD THROUGH THE METER INTO ASHBURN¿S NATURAL GAS FACILITIES.  GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (GPSC) INSPECTORS JOSH LAIRSEY AND ROB PACER WERE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45PM ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2010.   ASHBURN CITY MANAGER BEN TAYLOR ESTABLISHED A COMMAND CENTER AT CITY HALL TO DEVELOP A PLAN OF ACTION WITH ALL CITY PERSONNEL. DUE TO THE UNKNOWN VOLUME AND EXTENT OF PROPANE IN THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM, CITY PERSONNEL DECIDED TO BEGIN SHUTTING OFF ALL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WAS REQUESTED FROM AND PROVIDED BY THE CITIES OF DOUGLAS, TIFTON, CORDELE, SYLVESTER AND FITZGERALD.  ASHBURN CONFIRMED THAT THESE CITIES¿ PERSONNEL HAVE APPROPRIATE OPERATOR QUALIFICATIONS TO PERFORM THE REQUESTED TASK. THE SHUT OFF PROCESS BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00PM ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24TH, 2010.  ACTING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM GPSC TO REPORT THIS EVENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AS AN INCIDENT PURSUANT TO 49 CFR PART 191, BEN TAYLOR REQUESTED THAT THE SUBSCRIBED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE SERVICE (SRCS) MAKE THE TELEPHONIC REPORT ON BEHALF OF ASHBURN.   ON 9/24/2010 AT 3:16PM, SRCS MANAGER BILL DEFOOR CALLED THE NRC AND GAVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO KEVIN WILLIAMS, WHO ASSIGNED CASE #955047 TO THE REPORT.ON 9/24/2010 AT 6:59PM THE VALVE SUPPLYING NATURAL GAS TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS SHUT OFF.  THE SHUTTING OFF AND LOCKING OF ALL SERVICES WAS COMPLETE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:15AM ON 9/25/2010. DURING THE COMPLETION OF THE SHUT-OFF ACTION LINE PRESSURE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM DROPPED TO ZERO AS HAT CREEK CONSUMED THE REMAINING CONTAMINATED GAS THROUGH ITS PEANUT DRYERS. ON 9/25/2010 AT 9:00AM THE VALVE CONTROLLING THE GAS FLOW TO THE CITY WAS CUT BACK ON. AS A PRECAUTION, LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WERE MONITORED FOR 100% GAS USING (CGI) COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATORS. THE LOCATIONS THAT WERE MONITORED WERE INDUSTRIAL BLVD., CENTRAL PACKING PLANT, AND BRIDGES ROAD. WHEN 100% LEVELS WERE CONFIRMED, CREWS BEGAN CUTTING ON SERVICES AND RELIGHTING APPLIANCES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.  THE RELIGHTING PROCESS STARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM SATURDAY MORNING.

GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO FIVE OF THE HOMES BY 12:29 ON SEPTEMBER 3RD, 2010. THE OTHER THREE SERVICES WERE NOT RESTORED BECAUSE THE HOMES AND THEIR METER SETS WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. NO FURTHER DAMAGE OCCURRED TO OUR SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT.    GAS WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR, BUT NOT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. THE CAUSE OF THE BLAZE IS BELIEVED TO BE A GRASS FIRE FROM A NEARBY FIELD. PER THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT; 30-40 HOMES WERE EVACUATED, 11 HOMES WERE DESTROYED, NO FATALITIES OR HOSPITALIZATIONS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT IS ESTIMATED AT $4,405,743 (11 HOMES LOST, WORTH APPROX $400,000 EACH + AVISTA COSTS OF $5,743 FROM PART D). THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HOMES IS AN ESTIMATE BECAUSE THIS IS PRIVATE INFORMATION BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE HOMEOWNERS."

ALL FACILITIES IN THE TRENCH MELTED AND A BACKHOE WAS BURNED (TOTALLED).  NMGC PERFORMED A BARHOLE SURVEY UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE LEAK AND NO GAS WAS DETECTED.  NMGC WORKED WITH THE NM PIPELINE SAFETY BUREAU ON THE INVESTIGATION.  THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE ON WHAT CAUSED THE RELEASE OF GAS AND SUBSEQUENT IGNITION.  POSSIBLE CAUSES INCLUDE MECHANICAL DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE, VANDALISM, ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION OR A COMBINATION OF THESE SCENARIOS."

SPECIFICALLY, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE PIPE HAD BEEN UNCOVERED DURING A PREVIOUS EXCAVATION AND THAT THE BACKFILL WAS UNLAWFULLY AND INPROPERLY DUMPED BACK IN THE HOLE WITHOUT COMPACTION. THIS LEFT THE PIPE WITHOUT LATERAL SUPPORT FROM THE DOWNWARD LOADING CAUSED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE NON-COMPACTED BACKFILL, AND FROM OTHER POSSIBLE LOADINGS.

UPON ARRIVAL, THE HOME LOCATED AT 415 SOUTH 100 EAST WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, AND NATURAL GAS WAS ESCAPING NEAR THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOME FROM WHERE THE GAS METER ONCE WAS.    THE FORCE OF THE HOME EXPLODING CAUSED THE METER TO BE SEVERED FROM THE SERVICE LINE AND CAUSED THE UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS.  THE GAS DID NOT IGNITE OR EXPLODE.  THE METER WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOME.  THE 3/4 INCH NIPPLE GOING INTO THE REGULATOR HAD FAILED DUE TO THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION.    IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL QUESTAR PERSONNEL PERFORMED TESTS TO CHECK FOR GAS IN THE GROUND AROUND THE DAMAGED HOUSE AND IN THE SEWER MANHOLES.  NO GAS WAS DETECTED IN THE GROUND, IN THE TELEPHONE DUCT WORK OR IN THE SEWER.      QUESTAR PERSONNEL THEN BEGAN TO SECURE THE SITE AND CUT AND CAPPED THE DAMAGE SERVICE LINE.  THE SERVICE LINE WAS LEAK TESTED FROM THE CUT TO THE RISER.  NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.  THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS LEAK TESTED FROM THE CUT TO THE MAIN AND THEN PERMANENTLY RETIRED.

THE ADDITIONAL LEAK SURVEY INCLUDED ALL SURFACE STREETS, DUCTS, SEWERS, AND GAS LINE LOCATIONS WITHIN A TWO BLOCK LIMIT OF THE DAMAGED HOME.  NO LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED.    THE HOME WAS VACANT AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPLOSION.    THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME BY THE PLEASANT GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND UTAH STATE FIRE MARSHALL.    UPDATE:  BASED ON THE TESTING PERFORMED AT THE SITE, THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IS BELIEVED TO HAVE COME FROM CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING INSIDE THE HOME."

THE OCCUPANTS IN THE TRUCK LEFT THE SCENE ON FOOT AND THE DRIVER WAS ARRESTED LATER THAT AFTERNOON. THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE. JAMES ROBERT WATSON, HAD TO CLIMB OUT OF THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW TO ESCAPE THE FIRE. IN DOING SO, HE SLIPPED AND FELL TO THE GROUND BREAKING HIS BACK IN 3 PLACES AND ALSO BREAKING HIS PELVIS. HE WAS TAKEN TO ECM HOSPITAL IN FLORENCE AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO HUNTSVILLE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS. THE SERVICEMEN WHO RESPONDED SQUEEZED THE SERVICE LINE OFF TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS SO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD CONTAIN THE FIRE.

THE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS SHUT-OFF AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30PM. A LEAK SURVEY OF THE MAIN LINES AND SERVICE LINES ON W. 83RD BETWEEN MADISON AND LORAIN REVEALED NO INDICATIONS OF GAS NEAR THE STRUCTURE. A SERVICE LEAK AT 2131 WEST 83RD STREET WAS DETECTED DURING THE LEAK SURVEY. THIS SERVICE LINE WAS REPLACED UPON DISCOVERY.     ON TUESDAY, JANUARY 26TH, 2010 THE SERVICE LINE AT 2022 W. 83RD WAS AIR TESTED AT OPERATING PRESSURE WITH NO PRESSURE LOSS. AN ODOR TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT 2028 WAST 83RD STREET. THE RESULTS OF THIS ODOR TEST REVEALED ODOR LEVELS WELL WITHIN DOT COMPLIANCE LEVELS. OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED AN ODOR COMPLAINT AT THIS RESIDENCE ON JANUARY 18TH. DOMINION PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND MET WITH THE CLEVELAND FIRE DEPARTMENT. DOMINION FOUND THE METER DISCONNECTED AND THE METER SHUT-OFF VALVE IN THE HALF OPEN POSITION. THE SHUT-OFF VALVE WAS CLOSED BY THE DOMINION TECHNICIAN AND SECURED WITH A LOCKING DEVICE. THE TECHNICIAN PLACED A 3/4 INCH PLUG IN THE OPEN END OF THE VALVE. THE TECHNICIAN ALSO ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE CURB-SLOP VALVE, BUT COULD NOT. THE SERVICE LINE WAS THEN BAR HOLE TESTED UTILIZING A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR FROM THE STREET TO THE STRUCTURE.  AS A RESULT.  NO LEAKAGE WAS DISCOVERED. A SECOND ATTEMPT TO CTOSE THE CURB BOX  VALVE ON JANUARY 19TH ENDED WHEN BLOCKAGE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE VALVE BOX. THE VALVE BOX WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SCHEDULED FOR EXCEVATLON AND SHUT OFF BY A CONSTRUCTION CREW AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT SITE DETERMINED THE CAUSE TO BE ARSON AS APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES OF SERVICE LINE AND THE METER SHUT-OFF VALVE (WITH LOCKING DEVICE STILL INTACT), DETACHED FROM THE SERVICE LINE, WERE RECOVERED INSIDE THE STRUCTURE."
