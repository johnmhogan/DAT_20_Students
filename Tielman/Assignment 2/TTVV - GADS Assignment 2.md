1. Tielman Van Vleck
2. Working on two startups dealing with very different types of data, the more relevant: assessing small business credit risk using open data sources.
3. I've spent most of the last 10 years using natural language processing to pull patient data out of clinical notes for various types of analysis, including  thesis research using machine learning to look at patterns of use over a patient's history in order to predict what information will be relevant to a doctor at the point of care.
4. Interested in learning new tools/techniques, plus practice my Python.
5. Old news, but the most interesting thing I saw demonstrated last week: [New ML from Google for describing photo contents](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html)
