## Assignment 2

**Name:** Calista Nasser

**What I do:** The 9-to-5 grind.  I run analytics and MIS for a private bank team.

**The data:** I normally deal with client data for regulatory initiatives and reporting, but I'd *much* rather work with something more impactful. And also less messy data - you should see these Excel sheets people keep.

**Why I'm here:** I was always into math and science, got scared off when I was the only girl in my college math classes, and have recently been finding my way back to it.  Coding and heavy analytics is interesting to me but never something I studied, so I'm here to learn something new and perhaps change career industries in the process.

**A cool data link:** More visual than an article, but [this website](http://chartporn.org/) is just fun.
