## Assignment 3

**Name of algorithm:** Naive Bayes

**It solves:** Classification problems

**What it does:** Using historical data, it divides the number of times two scenarios occur together by the number of times the prior event has occurred.  This is used to classify certain outcomes and determine probability.

**Practical Applications:**

- Probability of certain behaviour in demographic groups, such as likelihood that customers under 50 increase spending.
- Text categorization; whether something is a valid form
- It seems like this would work with basic decision tree classification as well.
