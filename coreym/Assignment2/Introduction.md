##1. Name
Corey Maher
##2. Current "What I do during the day" status (work, student, mine bitcoins, etc)
I'm a product manager at [Oscar Insurance](http://www.hioscar.com/), a tech startup in SoHo that's trying to change healthcare. I work on our data team, which builds stuff that support the analytics team, and the data models that the frontend and mobile apps draw from. 
##3. A few examples of data you're interested in working with, or have worked with in the past
I love sankey diagrams! http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/foreign-fighters-flow-to-syria/2015/01/27/7fa56b70-a631-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_graphic.html

##4. Why you signed up for the data science course
I like the hacking, analysis, and presenting to businesspeople aspects of data science. I think I would be a "Data Businessperson" in the O'Reilly article homework for this class, I like the idea of moving my career in that direction at some point. More practically right now, I can use every bit of Python and SQL chops I can muster in my day job, and I am looking forward to better understanding the tools our analytics team, so I can help implement data processing pipelines that are usable for them. 

And of course, I'm here to get to know some other data types! [Please add me on linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/coreymaher) if you're so inclined. 
##5. An interesting blog post or website that is data oriented that you recently read or found.
[Many neat graphs here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/24/how-china-used-more-cement-in-3-years-than-the-u-s-did-in-the-entire-20th-century)
