#Name of Algorithm: 
Support Vector Machines
#What Data Problem Does it Solve?
Classification. I picked this because the description mentions that it supports text, which is something I'm interested in researching for sentiment analysis. 
#In layman's terms, what does the algorithm do? 
From the Wikipedia summary, it takes a training set of data that a human has marked as belonging to one of the two target categories, and uses that to map new observations into one of the two categories. 
#Come up with up to three applications of this algorithm in business.
I'm not sure if I will actually end up using this to do sentiment analysis on my data, but I am thinking about using this to assign transcribed call recordings into positive or negative sentiments. I'd like to get a realtime dashboard up that tracks the percentage of positive vs. negative calls in our call center. 

I work for a health insurer, so it'd be interesting to use this to analyze positive vs. negative health outcomes for specific doctors. If I provide it with a training set of procedures performed for a given diagnosis, could we predict whether a set of procedures will produce a positive or negative outcome?
