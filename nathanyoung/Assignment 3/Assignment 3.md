Support Vector Machine.
SVM is a technique for predicting a continuous numerical outcome; regression.
The goal of SVM is to determine where new data fits best using best fit lines.
SVM is useful for complex, real-world problems such as text and image classification, handwriting recognition, and bioinformatics and biosequence analysis.
