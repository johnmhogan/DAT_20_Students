Hi John - Couple of points of feedback regarding your presentation:
*Great job of visulizing some branding insights which I was definitely not aware of - Thank you!
*You loaded some modules into memory without actually using it, e.g.:from sklearn.cross_validation import StratifiedKFold
*You plotted the scatter and correlation matrices, but did not comment on any insights that it revealed
*The linear model plots from the seaborn library added a beautiful touch.

As a next step, I'd try to apply a linear model to determine which features best predict Total Preference Percentage.
